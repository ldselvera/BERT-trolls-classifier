"Very nice list here, as a new player myself with a fairly new DM he's noticeably followed most everything here and it's been wonderful all around. Cheers for writing it down for aspiring DMs out there!
I especially like that since we're using Roll20 and he's not exactly artistically talented, it's forced him to get a lot better at verbally explaining our surroundings. Which for me personally is a treat since it reminds me more and more of how a good book is written every session.
That said, for how amazing some people can be at verbally explaining things, it's not a bad idea to have a skeleton guide for visual reference for important things. (A magical door puzzle, a large scale building heist, etc etc) Not everyone has the best memory of remembering where everything was located.
I'm awful at being given 100% freedom for things, world creation especially, though one day I do hope to give being a DM a solid try, even if it's as a flavorful second in command, or using a mostly pre-written story.

"&gt; Considering that their commend linked to originally was about pointing out that they were acting like it was just a system of practices not beliefs, 

/u/guanzazai said ""Buddhism is more about practice than belief and scripture."" That's not saying beliefs are not involved or that it's just a system of practices. As I understand it, Buddhism is primarily about how to end suffering, so I wouldn't say the comment is too far off the mark.

You might also consider that one of the three fetters the stream-enterer eradicates is sceptical doubt -- since the stream-enterer has insight, they no longer have to take the Buddha's teachings on faith. I'm not saying that removes belief from Buddhism, but it does suggest that belief isn't necessary for a stream-enterer.

&gt; and they responded by taking that line out of context, it means they were once again using it in a misleading way, trying to crowbar the parts Buddhism wasn't vague on into the parts it was.

/u/guanzazai only offered the list in his original comment as a ""good starting point"". They also explicitly said it was about ""what unifies buddhist traditions"". They didn't claim it was comprehensive.",0

"On GF's 2015 taxes look at the line where she took a standard deduction. (1040A line 24, or 1040 line 40) 

If it says $9250 instead of $6300 then she made an error. It also will affect the income tax she wrote on a later line, because she looked up wrong value for taxable income, and she used the wrong column in tax table (HoH instead of Single).

The fix is to fill out Form 1040X and mail it in. On that form she has to write just some key values from her original filing, in column A, and then next to those write what they should be, in column C. The amount of change gets written in column B.

Instructions for 1040X help you see what each line is asking her to look for on her old filing. The line numbers on 1040X do not match the line numbers of her original form, so some care must be taken to consult the instructions.

I think it can be helpful to actually fill out a new dummy tax form with all the corrected numbers. Then use old and new  as references to fill in the 1040X. The IRS specifically says not to send a revised 1040 itself, so just keep it as a resource.

She will then learn what her real tax amount was, and how much she needs to send in. The extra $2950 of taxable income that will happen by dropping her deduction from $9250 to $6300 means more tax. Also, I think tax brackets for HoH are different than for Single, so tax will change for that reason.

Back page of 1040X asks for a brief explanation of why amending. She could just say, ""Changed filing status from Head of Household to Single because no qualifying person.""

----

Update:

:~~She can still list you as a dependent and get an exemption for that which helps reduce her income subject to tax.~~ 

Edit: You mentioned you traveled all of 2015. To be her dependent qualifying relative you have to have lived with her all year. Temporary absence due to ""vacation"" is okay ... but if she did not supply over half the cost of your support, she can't claim you as a dependent. So determine if she should even include you as a dependent on 2015 taxes.",0

He heard a voice screaming, ""Breathe, goddammit! Breathe, Paul!"" The lips clamped down again. The breath blew down his throat again. Blew down it like the dank suck of wind which follows a fast subway train, pulling sheets of newspaper and candy-wrappers after it, and the lips were withdrawal, and he thought For Christ's sake don't let any of it out through your nose but he couldn't help it and oh that stink, that stink that f**king STINK.
""Breathe, goddam you!"" the unseen voice shrieked, and he thought I will, anything, please just don't do that anymore, don't infect me anymore, and he tried, but before he could really get started her lips were clamped over his again, lips as dry and dead as strips of salted leather, and she raped him full of her air again.""

"&gt; His abilities seem to be somewhat driven by toonforce, or at least allowed by the absurd physics of the manga world he occupies
You're comparing him to the Marvel universe where characters regularly move faster than light, create and destroy energy, and violate numerous laws of physics.
&gt;  The fact that he smashes boulders and concrete walls easily, isn't so amazing when everyone else in the world is capable of similar behavior at will.
I'm talking about *Ranma VS Spider-Man*, not *Ranma VS Other Ranma Characters*. What even is this argument? Because other people in his world can do what he does, we have to discount all of his feats?
&gt; ...he gets beaten by his opponents all the time, too. Happosai, Mousse, Ryoga, and even Kuno have beaten him before through various means.
Ranma has never lost in a fair fight. Whenever he's been beaten, his opponent has had some kind of magic power-up.
&gt; Every time he gets defeated is just another opportunity for him to learn another technique, but he doesn't become ""superhuman"" at any point in the series.
Stop using this ridiculous argument! Just because isn't technically ""a superhero"" doesn't mean that he's weak and pathetic.
&gt; That is to say, he doesn't become untouchable by normal folk. He's still just as vulnerable to casual punishment from his father or Akane, who are significantly weaker than him.
Then how do you explain him tanking lightning or the Demon God Assault Bomb? Remember, everybody in the Ranma 1/2 series is a martial artist beyond what a human can do. Even Kuno regularly smashes through brick walls with his bamboo training sword, and Akane knocks people around like pillows.
&gt; Some strength feats:
These lifting feats are moderately better than Ranma's lifting feats, but he's still outclassed in pretty much every category.
&gt; Two speed feats from RT, but I know there's better ones
These aren't any better than Ranma's feats of [picking up shrapnel from Ryoga's Batsukai Tenketsu](http://imgur.com/othCRWG) or [hitting a person hundreds of times so fast it looks like it's only one punch](http://imgur.com/CuVDewp), or blocking [eight hundred blows](http://imgur.com/l12sPKx).
&gt; there's no chance he could escape
I don't think Ranma will even get hit by that webbing in the first place due to the speed advantage. Plus, you still haven't shown that the webbing could resist Ranma blasting his way out with Mokotaka Bisha or Shishi Hokudan.",0

"The criteria for concluding that someone was raped were if someone: 
&gt;overwhelm you with arguments or continual pressure for sex, use physical force, threaten to harm you or someone close to you, perform sexual acts while you were incapacitated by drugs or alcohol
Most of these are pretty widely open to interpretation.  What exactly constitutes ""overwhelming you with pressure for sex""?  Asking twice?  Three times?  If someone goes in for a kiss without asking, is that using physical force?  Is ""my judgement was impaired by drugs or alcohol"" the same as ""I was *incapacitated* by drugs and alcohol""?
I also love the SWJ creed of ""If a woman says she's been raped, she's been raped,"" yet almost all of these surveys avoid explicitly asking if a woman has been raped.  Why?  Because when they ask that, they don't get such high numbers.  Because most of the women they consider to have been raped answer that they haven't been raped.  So somehow the logic is ""A woman knows if she's been raped or not, except when we say she's hasn't and we say she has, in which case she doesn't know if she's been raped or not.""
And, finally, as usual, the survey defines rape as penetrative acts and only asks women about their experiences.  Of course there's no question as to if any *men* are ""continually pressured"" into sex or if any *men* have sexual acts performed on them while they are incapacitated by drugs or alcohol - we want to continue branding rape as ""a thing that men do to women"", so why would we ruin that by potentially revealing the prevalence of men who have these same experiences?

That said, if the statistics of 24000 applications for 7000 volunteers, that's a 30% chance of making it to country. I know they account for people not getting medically cleared now, so maybe slightly higher, depending on sector/location. So no, most folks do not get accepted and many I've seen on here have had to apply multiple times.
Places like the Phillipines, Central/South America, Eastern Europe tend to be higher demand and things like teaching (50% of all openings) are always in higher need. So if you are looking at a teaching positions in Sub-Saharan Africa, your chances may be statistically higher than say a CED position in Eastern Europe, but those statistics change based on the applicant pool, number of applications, time of year, etc.
Not sure if that's what you were looking for, but definitely reach out to a recruiter to make sure you are accurately portraying yourself in terms Peace Corps understands to give yourself the best chance.

"1. There is a lot of ongoing research on color centers, as you may know. For quantum memories, a good coherence time and a good photonics interface are critical. Some of the currently studied color centers have good coherence times, but optical interfaces are challenging, because these color centers are sensitive to nearby surfaces (e.g., NV center in diamond). Other centers like SiV in diamond are less sensitive to nearby surfaces in optical structures, but have shorter coherence times (although this may be improved by some careful and smart engineering).
I think that the ongoing research looking into various color centers in group IV materials and rare earth doped crystals is very exciting, and that the best material for quantum memories is yet to be identified. Nevertheless, there is a lot of potential for color centers beyond quantum memories - for example in optical switching devices, or quantum light sources (neither of these require long coherence times).
2. I already answered another question on multi-emitter CQED , but here is a copy of that reply.
 We are very interested in multi-emitter cavity QED systems, where several emitters are collectively strongly coupled to a cavity. Here is our recent theory work, and we are working on the experimental demonstration of these effects on the diamond color-centers platform (where inhomogeneous broadening of quantum emitters is very small): Nonclassical Light Generation in Two-Emitter-Cavity Systems, Marina Radulaski, Kevin A. Fischer, Konstantinos G. Lagoudakis, Jingyuan Linda Zhang, Jelena Vuckovic.

- Wealth of knowledge in the group and different perspectives.
- Personal stories from the commentators
- Information about the players and video clips of them.
- Additions of other GM/SGM such as Eric / Kasparov (via Phone) joining the show
Challenges
- Maurice has a hard time sharing the stage. Might be best to not pair him up with someone at his computer.

"In order of preference:
****
**Fanny and Alexander** (5 hour TV version) Ingmar Bergman, 1982. 
This film is Bergmans magnum-opus and the finale of my dedicated year living on the same island he did. I watched the 188-minute cut last fall and I am pleased to say I was equally blown away by this semi-rewatch. The way he manoeuvres from reality into fantasy and/or super natural dimensions really gets me. I've always been able to identify naturally with Bergmans authorship and his narratives, but this film lifts the personal bond with me to a higher ground. The dichotomy between a fathers ""love"" and brutal punishments is hauntingly portrayed, and allows the audience to really feel and contemplate the love/discipline relationship . 5/5. 
****
**The New World** Terrence Malick, 2005. (Rewatch)
Man, I fucking love Malick. This being his most speculative and contemplating film right after *The Tree Of Life*, I unceasingly love it. The long, resting nature shots coupled together with a rambling voice-over just does it for me. Instantaneous love, no questions asked. I read somewhere that a critic once said that Malick does not shoot in a literary or theatrical fashion; but in a cinematic fashion. There's no need for a complex plot or an epic character arc for the viewer to feel big emotions, and that is what Malick proves to you in his moviemaking. 5/5.
****
**Ex Machina** Alex Garland, 2015. 
In spite of fearing that this film was just another over-hyped plastic sci-fi horror trip,  I did quite like this. Not only is it so very timely in its themes, but it also surprised me with some experimental and daring story telling. The way Garland tricks you into identifying with the different characters over time is a clear sign of his directorial (read manipulative) skills. I mean I was not only mind-fucked but I was defiantly lured into both loving Ava and at the same time also fearing her. The film finally left me with a hole in my stomach that could only be filled with a large glas of scotch. 4/5. 
***
**Antichrist** Lars von Trier, 2009
Von Trier continues to imbue me with a loving sickness for his dark, ambiguous films. A few moments in this film stood out to me and continue to lurk in my mind, especially the scene were the gizzard-leaking fox informs you that ""chaos reigns"". I get shivers just thinking about it. Overall I am not super excited about the general impression of the film but then again I am never so by von Triers films. His genius, if he has one, lies for me in his capability to render some unique and powerful scenes, not in creating thoroughly cinematic experiences or masterpieces. Strong 3/5. ",0

I didn't take 'draining the swamp' to mean fire everyone in the government. I think he'd have a hard time governing that way. And even if that is what he meant, he cant do that on day one. Unless he was a moron, and he wouldn't get anything done. I think draining the swamp is something that needs to happen gradually and hopefully by the end of his presidency we are better in that department. Banning his team from being lobbyists and putting in congressional term limits would be an amazing start.

Just because he hires someone with one particular opinion does not mean that the person's opinion becomes policy. Trump likes pragmatism. It's less about your beliefs and more about how competent you are at performing tasks. 

He's not starting a nuclear arms race with Russia. That is classic Trump misdirection. Russia couldn't hang with us in an arms race for 5 minutes and they know that. That's how they lost the cold war, they couldn't afford that shit. However we are really going to invest in military technology, he will not want the whole world to know about it. He will not always announce our foreign policy goals like Obama does. Doing that puts you at a severe negotiating disadvantage and gives people the opportunity to gear up to oppose you.

Idgaf if he appoints someone to deal with Crooked. That's not his job to prosecute, and that would not be good for his image. He'll let the AG do his job and if there is a basis for prosecution, she will be prosecuted. 

I think you are the one Trump is tricking. I know how to read between the lines of what he says. He uses a lot of misdirection and choreographed ""buffoonery"" to stay unpredictable and enrage his enemies, making them appear hysterical.

The modDemix makes it easy to visually map the change because it has +/- LEDs. So you can see when the signal starts to veer into RM territory as the - LEDs start to fade in. You can take it all the way through to 0 - -10v modulation, but that's effectively back to unipolar AM.

"It's not necessarily a constant decline.  Most of the Third Era saw relative prosperity and pretty advanced magic/technology.  From the dawn of the Third Era to the start of the Oblivion Crisis is exactly the same length of time as the period from the founding of the Roman Empire by Caesar Augustus to the [Crossing of the Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine) by Germanic barbarians at the start of the 5th century.  Seriously. 433 years.
That's what we're meant to be witnessing - the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire.
Just because Rome fell though doesn't mean it's entire history was one of decline.  It had its day in the sun.
&gt;With that in mind, I think in the long term for Bethesda to follow through on MK's ideas for an The Elder Scrolls End Times would be disastrous.
I don't.  It would just need to be handled right, and have some sort of a silver lining that makes your actions in this and previous games feel impactful.  I'm sure there are lots of ways to accomplish that.
There's plenty of precedent for showing the previous games to have had more of a downer than we realized at the time too. The positive feeling endings of Morrowind and Oblivion turned out to have pretty terrible consequences down the road, which we don't realize until Skyrim.
&gt;At the end of the day, nothing is making Bethesda canonize MKs projection for a post Skyrim Elder Scrolls canon. At the end of the day, we're all just tinfoiling for fun until Bethesda drops The Elder Scrolls VI a few years from now.
So what?
Not to mention, there's a fair amount of references to the more ""out there"" lore (ie MK, Kuhlman, etc) in Elder Scrolls Online, and datamined content suggests there was even more originally.  As in the final boss fight was going to be one for control of the stone of the Ur-Tower.  Seriously. So clearly there are a decent number of people at Bethesda and Zenimax who appreciate this work.",0

"Met a girl on Match.com. Online, she's average-looking, maybe a little fat. She's very receptive to my advances, so I agreed to take her out to a bar to watch a football game on a Saturday night. I was barely below 25 BMI at the time anyway, and my shitlord identity was far from fully formed.
In person,  she was the stereotypical fat girl: big, puffy face; frumpy dress with a bow on the back; too much make up and perfume and jewelry;  etc.
I was nice. I had been busting my ass at work and I was kind of glad just to be out. Our waitress (hot,  skinny, older redneck girl) said we looked ""cute together"" and I almost vomited. I guess she was trying to throw her sister an assist...?
I was surprised by how unattractive I found her... it's like, as the weight goes up,  attractiveness goes down exponentially or something. It wasn't just the weight, it was the whole desperate package.

*  Game 2, I was happy with the running around and using lasers, forcing badwolf to approach, but sometimes i did them mindlessly and got punished for it since I wasn't respecting how far quick-draw can go.
* Game 3, challenging Ike's recovery badly way too late and getting punished for it
* I got caught tech rolling in a few times and got punished with an Fsmash from ike. I think I did alright mixing up my tech options but if that's primarily what he's covering then I shouldn't be teching into him.
* Some tech skill flubs that can be grinded out in the lab (Missed L-Cancels, accidental full-hops)

"Huh?
If God is omniscient, he knows exactly what we will all do, long before He creates us. That is the definition of omniscient.
The very point is that assuming God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent leads to a contradiction, so our assumption is wrong: God must not be all of those things.
The classic argument goes:
Why is there evil? If God could have created a perfect world with no evil, and he was benevolent, he would have done that. So he is either not omnipotent (since he cannot create a world without evil) or not omnibenevolent (since he is allowing evil to exist). Or of course he didn't known that there would end up being evil, which means he isn't omniscient... and even then, can he not simply change anything and everything by taking all the evil away? Why doesn't he? Either he is allowing evil to occur when he could prevent it, so isn't omnibenevolent, or he can't prevent it, and isn't omnipotent.
You can kind of say the same things about omniscience and free will. If God knows everything you would say or do when he created you, isn't he expressly forcing you to do those things by creating the you that does those things? If he doesn't know what you would do and you could freely do anything then he isn't Omniscient. If he couldn't create a version of you that does any number of things differently (such that you claim while he knows what you will do it is all by your choice and he can't stop you from doing any of it) then he isn't omnipotent, since he couldn't stop you.

"We looked at it and eventually just gave up and bought a house and ""stretched"" to hit our mortgage because the price difference between buying a 1940s home and fixing up a bit versus building new was huge ($200k). 
The only way you can get a new home on a decent budget is to severely compromise on materials. If you want something done properly by qualified tradies you're looking at half a million to $600k realistically once you factor in the land and all the costs associated with prepping the land. 
And don't cheap out on space either. It doesn't mean you need a 250 sq m behemoth mansion but 100 to 150 sq m is pretty bog standard these days and its now about what you need at 21. It's what you need at 31 and 41 if you plan on staying and trying to pay off the mortgage and make it your own. 
And when it comes down to it... we found we could get way better quality by buying an old council house and fixing it than buying new. ""They just don't make 'em like they used to"" is literally true.

There's also power in widening the discussion and not trapping ourselves in a comfortable niche. Every time a mainstream media ethics scandal arises, we gain subscribers, often because we're gamedropped. This raises two issues.
If GamerGate is going to be randomly attacked by people reviewing films such as Ghostbusters, or in regards to the Gawker judgment, why shouldn't we have right of reply in our own home?
Secondly, when these new people do come here and see the other side of the story, why should we turn them away as newly minted allies simply because some of us are afraid of broadening our scope and want to stay pigeonholed?
KiA, as I understand it, stands for two things - media ethics and freedom of speech - and is the largest community on Reddit I know of that doesn't actively censor. It may have started out as simply ethics in game journalism, but society itself has changed since then, and there's nothing wrong with our mandate having evolved accordingly.

It saves you time and money as well if you don't care so much about having the best SSS gear for your allies.
Sometimes you can get some SS gear that even better than SSS gear. I got a Longsword of Corruption that had more attack and better stats then the 3 Awakened Longswords that I got. I used it with an Armor of Corruption for the stat bonus and to save me essences for other allies. It's up to you how you want to play.

"The lesson being stay out of peoples backyards that don't want you there, the us may win the battle but the PR war was lost a long time ago. The us went from having the sympathy of the world after 9/11 to a few years later being vilified for the invasion of Iraq. And it can't be said the PR war is not important, the rise of support for anybody but the us grows everyday, sure russia and china may be merciless when and where they rule but the fallout from the past 15 years has pissed off a lot of people and they don't forget as easy anymore due to even simple sources such as wikipedia, now all it takes is a reference, an image or a video and a slight distrust can be built to full on rage. While before it was condemned to a history book in a library, videos such as collateral murder and images of abu ghraib will anger people for a long time to come.
It doesn't help the the us charges into these conflicts under the guise of being a bastion of freedom and democracy no one one believes it any more anyway. The likes of russia and china have no qualms of saying we are going here and doing it because we want this shit plain and simple. The us is has water on either side of it and has a header and footer of pretty happy neighbours its only card to play is the freedom one coming straight out and saying we need war to keep our economy going don't taste so good.
Iraq will fall under the russian sphere of influence after they are done with syria, as iran is. Afghanistan will return to the tailban control, the only thing remaining being the couple humvees that the us couldn't be arsed bringing back. The only question is how long till a full pull out, they got all time in the world its their country (even if its not, if they are foreign fighters ,they see it that way). They don't have a uniform they can farm on their off days between reading the koran and walking through the rubble, they don't have a timescale its just sit and wait for them and they know it.

"From his perch, Caster watched the battle with fascination, and a degree of anxiety on whether he ought to help or not. Berserker was proving to be tough as hell. All the efforts of the two servants facing him seemed to put them two steps forward and one step back. 
He knew he had told Giselle he didn't want to fight just yet, but maybe helping them just this once would be a good idea - they might remember him in a good light later down the line. Besides, they must have had good reason to bother with even dealing with Berserker.
*Sorry, master. Turns out I lied.*
The redhead swung his legs out and dropped to the ground. There, he cracked his fingers and focused his mind for a few seconds to form the tools he'd need. An easel with a canvas, which formed itself before him. A palette with paint, which materialized in his hand. And finally a brush, which also formed in his hand.
Caster got to work, his paintbrush flying between the palette and canvas. Quick, expressive  strokes of the brush formed the abstract bodies of crows. And those abstract bodies came to life, literally.
The paint seemed to pull itself off the canvas to transform into the bodies of the black birds, which then took to the sky in a racket of feathers and cawing, gathering in number above the trees as their artist worked feverishly at the canvas to produce a decently-sized flock. Then, as though given command, they made a dive for Berserker, all wings and talons and angry beaks.",0

Not to mention because of the 7-day trade lock on new drops which they had to introduce due to a few bad people running major fraud operations against Daybreak, so these packs allow people to mass open crates before the first of the crates start showing up on the Steam Market 7 days after its put into the game.",0

"I understand the notion to bring every character to a state where their absolute beasts. Who would want a battle when you could have a mini-war? But just ""buffing everyone up to insane amounts of power so every naut is balanced and feels awesome to play"" is stupid for Awesomenauts and MOBAs most of the time. 

Imagine the balance terror if suddenly Clunk, Gnaw, Skree, etc. All the characters considered unviable for competitive, or just not high-tier were all buffed to the power level (whatever that is) of Penny?
Imbalance, exploits, the whole meta would shift. What if I liked how Clunk played before he was buffed to his ""real state."" Because you couldn't possibly like a character that isn't a ""high power level"" right?

Following the Coco and Derpl example, what *does* happen when Derpl's defense is buffed. It's great that he can easily fend off Coco, but Coco is still his hard counter. Because of Derpl's big gimmick (no mobility for extra power in siege mode, he will always be countered by her. Coco will still be able to shoot out a ball and hit him every 5 seconds, and she will be able to escape him easily. The matchup between those two characters has barely changed. The only way you could really make Coco and Derpl equals in the ring if they have equal weaknesses and strengths against each other. Of course that would require changing how the entire character works, which is even more of a glance nightmare.

But let's pretend that the matchup between these two is now balanced. Each is very powerful and equally dangerous to each other now. What about the other nauts? Raising Derpl's defense just made it a fuckton harder for melee characters to approach! Now Derpl can turtle much much safer and longer! Oh I'm not dealing with another Derpl camping Ribbit mid, let's leave! Etc. See the problem? Well let's just buff the characters that now have problems with Derpl! And the cycle goes on.

Lastly, nerfs aren't a bad thing. Some characters need them. It's that simple. As long as it doesn't ruin the character then I don't see the problem. No, I don't want the characters to progress through a steady line of nerfs. But let's all stop pretending that nobody receives buffs, or that everyone being buffed will somehow make the game leagues better than it is now.

You know she loves you, right? That she's trying to set you up to succeed, and wants you to live a safe and happy life? That for some odd and unexplainable reason, parents feel invested in making sure their children have a good future ahead of them?

And that you're throwing that in her face by breaking promises and suddenly deciding to throw away your entire life to go off and fulfill some dangerous childhood fantasy? And then you act all impressed with yourself because ""she's just hurting herself"" by not talking to you. Because you apparently don't give a shit about HER at all. You just want her around when and how it benefits you without having to concern yourself with anything else.

Listen. You may technically be an adult, but you sure as shit are not acting like one. You're making a stupid decision and you're making it in the stupidest and most hurtful way possible, and acting the whole time like you're some guru of knowledge and she's just the childish controlling narcissist that needs to be put in her place.

And I'm guessing you're not exactly a master actor that can hide this attitude from her, and I bet you wouldn't even try either.",0

As he passed by the tables he went through his regular routine of checking the patrons faces and then glancing at their sigils, the latter step lasting longer for the women of The Sphinx. Moving by a blackjack table he was stopped in his tracks by a more than familiar sigil accompanied by a rather familiar face.

"Yes, but, the difference is that titans were predicted to remain few in number at a relatively early part in the game's life, a lot has gone on since then to make that prediction false.  However, in this case it is severely unlikely to happen in the same way- not to say that someone won't build one, but that it will NEVER be anything even conceivably close to a reasonable amount of isk, because the amount of expansion the game would have to see in order for that to happen is astronomically unlikely.  EVE has had its time to mature since titans were thought to be impossible to build in huge numbers, but the e-peen citadel still represents something like 5% of the combined total wealth of the entirety of the EVE universe, which is an absurd total.  We would have to see a multi-fold increase in player base or efficiency in mining/producing the required building materials for it to become possible to build in any reasonable sense- again not to say it won't be built, however unreasonable.",0

This sentence is incomplete. It is also possible he doesn't know ""what.""
This has little to do with gun control and everything to do with gun safety. None of these people were carrying their firearm legally or in a holster designed for the weapons. There is no reason law abiding men and women should have their rights changed to preserve the genitals of people who were breaking the law in the first place. These people shot themselves because they didn't place enough value on safety to:
1) Learn how to use the weapon properly, including storage.
2) Buy the right equipment to carry it (which costs 10% of what the weapon does.)
3) Obey the law.",0

"Giving an honest response I don't see how that PBS video would cost 2-3 k for the production step. I doubt anyone doing an educational video would actually hire an actor to memorize a script. They(should) get or already have someone who knows what they are talking about, and then make sure he follows bullet points. But maybe he is a spokesperson reading a prompter of some sort he looks like he might be.

That shoot didn't even require any fancy shooting it's just a camera on a tripod anyone somewhat competent with cameras can do.

So all the person is looking for is either studio rental time for like an hour, very minimal set up is used, so they have access to a solid color background wall/paper, which is normally green, and 1 semi competent person to set up the camera and make sure audio is fine. You normally can't rent out a studio for just an hour usually have minimal half day to full day. So they plan more than 1 shot.

Studios come with the competent person to help initial set up and the camera normally. If someone is charging 2-3 k for that part for something as simple as that then they're over charging by a factor of 10 or more.


Now the editing part is pretty well done. I don't know if those graphics were already in some public repository somewhere(they probably were), or if they were made just for that. The editor for that probably spent maybe 8 hours for those 10 minutes and was decently skilled. This depends on how much pre-planning was in it though. So he can charge $50 to $100 an hour. Assuming very little pre planning and he made the story himself.

A lot of pre-planning went into that though which took up most of the time. It normally should be the person who is hiring these people who do these pre-planning steps. Though someone who doesn't have a clue about what types of pre-planning needs to be done should team up or hire someone who does have a clue, that part could get as expensive as the editor and that is where the director is needed. That advice is usually also given out freely if you purchase studio time. It's pretty much only writing a script, story-boarding, and giving a repository of graphics that you want used.

I do know it's becoming the trend to overcharge on everything because there simply isn't enough work to go around and make a living off of it. But I don't agree with that.. I like giving honest answers. If high skills are necessary then they should charge whatever they want. But to over charge on something something as easy as a stable camera on a tripod and claim it's something highly technical to do. Just begrudges potential and current customers.

Why can I say all of this? I don't have 10+ years of experience but I do have 3+ years of experience at a tv studio and editing room which was rented out daily. My job was jack of all trades and I was always that semi-competent person who were on these 1-3 stable camera interview/green screen type shots, grip, audio etc. I was also the semi-competent editor who sometimes only followed the cut and paste storyboard that someone else already put together for me. If it's all planned out exactly then anyone can do the job. I became competent enough that I took my own jobs and still stuck to the single camera stuff. Even went into the film industry as well and attempted to start my own studio.",0

"Honestly, the excitement is probably that if you just let the bacteria be in a current, that they orient themselves automatically to move ""up stream"", which creates the effect of shoveling water downstream.
Which makes the flow faster, in this case roughly proportional to the energy it would lose due to friction.

Which means that if you had a system where ""less energy to pump water a long way"" is way more important than ""the water must be free of particles"", you could enrich the water with specific manipulated bacteria to reduce the need for pumps.

or, you could think of it the other way round.
What if you could make pipes or inserts into pipes where this ""movement"" created by something fixed in place, then you could move the water without a mechanical pump.

As far as the simulation goes:
It depends on  the abstraction.
Basically you can reduce the bacteria to ""a tiny particle that creates a tiny amount of thrust"". And you can then run simulations with different stochastic distributions of orientation.
If they are truly oriented at random, the net thrust should be zero, but there should be some disruption of laminar flow (which would look like a bit increased viscosity.).
If you simulate them all (or predominantly) oriented in the direction of the flow, there would be a net thrust with the flow. (which would look like decreased viscosity.)

So someone probably proposed that the bacteria ""put their nose in the wind"", and calculated how much that would increase the flow, and turns out, that's what they do.",0

"Mugi's eyebrows are yellow here because in Japan, yellow can symbolize courage and nobility. Both of which are good descriptors of Mugi's character. She comes from a wealthy, powerful family and she is constantly summoning the courage to try new things. Her happily giving away one of her yellow eyebrows to Yui symbolizes how she is investing her wealth, courage, and identity into the K-On! club and friendship.
Yui is a character known for spacing out and not thinking very much. This is highlighted by her blank, white eyes that lack any real insight and an exaggerated, childish face. It isn't shown in this gif, but Mugi places her pickle eyebrow onto a bowl of rice for Yui to eat. Yui eating Mugi's tasty pickle eyebrow symbolizes how Yui is accepting all of Mugi as a precious friend. It could also represent how Yui thinks Mugi is so cute that she could just eat her up. The bizarrenness of this scene is due to Yui's unconscious perception of Mugi manifesting itself through a dream.
Edit: Also, a big part of Yui is her love of food. She wrote all the lyrics for a song about RICE of all things. So her eating a piece of Mugi with rice is a nice mixture of their character traits.",0

"How am I misleading, again? I pointed out that pogroms *preceded* Zionism. Where am I being deliberately misleading?
In 1885 there were already attacks on Jewish immigrants documented, 4 years into Zionism and with hardly any Zionists there. The movement was essentially tiny and unknown, Herzl hadn't taken the lead (and wouldn't for 12 years), and fewer than 20,000 Jews had arrived. Why attack them?
Why attack them in 1870 in Jerusalem? Or in 1847? Or in Jaffa in 1876? Damascus 1840, 1848, 1890? Beirut 1864 and 1872?
I am pointing out *more* history, pre-Zionist tensions. Did those occur in a vacuum? No. But there is nothing to explain why they spread throughout the 19th century, unless of course you accept that Bernard Lewis' history is right when he wrote of rising anti-Semitism as the Ottoman Empire weakened. And you accept that anti-Semitism worsened still after Ottoman Muslims and others were told they had to be *equal* to Jews in social status, as an Ottoman official noted *upset other minorities too*. Having to be equal to the Jews was ""upsetting"" after 1865, and anti-Semitism was already on the rise. I'm simply pointing out that the rise was before Zionism, and continued after it, explaining that Zionism was never the root cause of distress, and that the distress preceded Zionism.",0

These days I wouldn't go with the power flush any longer as the high quality low flush toilets are designed totally differently and work very well.  I'd buy a Toto brand toilet.
2.  There is something clogging the toilet which interferes with the flush.  It could be as simple as a pen, stick, or toy that someone tried flushing at some point.  You can try snaking the toilet and if that doesn't help, take up the toilet and check from the bottom up if there is something partially obstructing the trap.
3.  There is a blockage in the sewer drain line from the toilet.  This is the least likely as it would probably get backed up more often, even with a liquid only flush.",0

"65% winrate butcher main here
I see many butchers just picking the wrong build(aka trait build) even when it is not the optimal choise(against alot of stuns for example)
I don't think the butcher is an all-in hero, people think he is because of his kit, but imo he is much better played defensively and as a chaser and very occasionaly as an initiator.
The only time you can initiate as butcher is when the enemy team has no CC at all AND if your team is capable of following up.
At the end of fights butcher can chase low HP heroes like no other hero can
For playing as defense, you just wait for the enemy team to initiate, and charge into the initiator. He will be stunned for a second while your team can do things. Also butchers charge make him unstoppable, so you can stop moshpit
Also after you charge into an enemy, position yourself in front of him and THEN slow him down with the hammer, so you can bodyblock while he panics and moves slow
I'll give a small overview for every talent
**Level 1**
Invigoration - I take this talent when i know i will pick lvl 4 Flail Axe. I recommend using this if you are against 2 tanks and squishies or if you are up against tracer
Block - Don't pick this
Chop meat - On maps like spiderqueen this can be pretty good and this talent removes the need of lvl7 abattoir talent, opening up variety
Victuals - Take this in any other circumstance
**Level 4**
Flail Axe - In combination with Invigoration, this can be annoying for pretty much every assassin and especially stealths, also works with chop meat
Unrelenting Pursuit - You take this when enemy team has almost no CC and they have high mobility heroes
Cheap Shot - Works great in combination with jaina, xul, anyone with a consistent slow, root or stun really
Envenom - no reason to take this at all, the damage is just too low for butcher
**Level 7**
Brutal Strike - gives alot of burst to butcher, this is good against heroes who stick to your face for a few seconds like tracer and zeratul. Works even better with lvl1 invigoration
Insatiable Blade - gives you HUGE heals from butchers brand(250% of attack damage). This is a must pick when there is no support on your team or when they have alot of melee characters.
Abattoir - If you have taken chop meat, there is no reason to pick this unless you take blood frenzy on level 16. The only time you can pick blood frenzy is when enemy team has none or weak CC.
**Level 10**
Both ults are good and have their uses, i prefer furnace blast over lamb to the slaughter though
Furnace Blast - Take this when they have alot of melee characters, it is not advised to go deep into the enemy team with this ult even though it is tempting.
Lamb to the slaughter - Take this when you need to erase a caster or if you need to chase alot. Works great in combination with insatiable blade for insane heals. It is not advised to use this against heroes with high mobility like falstad, zeratul and tracer, unless you are certain their mobility is on cooldown. 
**Level 13**
Burning rage - Never take this
Savage Charge - Only take this when they have alot of high health heroes
Crave Flesh - the best talent in this tier, gives butcher the much needed speed after you charge into someone
Spell shield - I do not think there is a need for a spell shield since butcher should not be the first to go into the fight, unless he is the only initiator, then you can consider taking this against alot of spell burst
**level 16**
Cripling slam - Does not compete with the other 2 talents
Enraged - my favorite talent of the butcher. this is sadly overlooked by Blood Frenzy. While blood frenzy gives you a consistent attack speed buff, it does not help you against stuns. When you fall below 50% hp , ALL stuns, roots, silences and slows will only last for 25% of the original duration, meaning you build up alot of resistance to them. In addition you get an extra 40% attack speed, which is more than what blood frenzy can ever give you. After enraged is activated, you should activate butchers mark on the target that will most likely stick to you(low mobility heroes or tanks). What usually happens is that the enemy team starts focusing you because you are low, but you will have insane damage output while healing trough the sky
Blood frenzy - If the enemy team has weak CC, you can take this but then you pretty much have to take Abattoir at level 7.
**Level 20**
Fires of hell - Good upgrade on furnace blast, take this when they have 3+ melee heroes who stick to you 
Slaughterhouse - If you took the lamb to the slaughter ult, you should pick this, it is almost like void prison except you can still damage the enemies.
Nexus Blades - If you feel like you dont need the ult upgrade, take this talent as it gives you not only increased damage, but also increased heal from brand
Bolt of the storm - I like to take this against high mobility heroes, nothing feels better than bolting after a tracer who just recalled and delevering the final blow

We aren't mountaineers. We are hoping for some trails as seen in Gatineau Park in Ottawa. Medium difficulty, maybe a long route to higher elevation if needed rather than steep ones.

"From the information you provided it sounds like your interviewing skills might be holding you back.
Im really clinging onto the ""you aren't qualified enough"" remark you have been getting. That gives you a lot of information. 
If you have had tons of interviews then on paper you have enough qualifications to be worthy of an interview. Which means between the start of the interview and the end of the interview their view of you changes from ""may have enough experience for this position""  to ""is not qualified"".  
As you have said at this point you can't get much more experience without that critical first job. But you can work on presenting the experience you do have as effectively as possible in an interview. 
Head down to the local library and start perusing job hunting books and books specifically about interviewing. I highly recommend books for this kind of research, as internet advice can vary wildly in quality and the content creator has a personal interest in presenting what people *want* to hear, which isnt always good advice.

"C. Drafted Porzingis+Hernangomez and picked up some potentials for the future.
The Melo saga makes him come off as a terrible executive. Trying to force your star player to want to leave the team through other ways such as dogging him out in press conferences, interviews and through his writer friend. It's one thing to do all of that, but it's another to have to do all of that because you gave him the NTC to begin with. You would get scraps for him anyway. If he was't going to come to the Knicks without the NTC, he should have just let him walk. Phil wanted to rebuild anyway. There's been talks that Dolan wanted Phil to re-sign Melo so he did, I don't know if it's true or not but there's been several new york media guys who've mentioned it now.
There's been rumors that he was generally unavailable at the deadline for other GMs to contact him to begin with. Jerian+Lopez for Rose/Justin is what it is, that wasn't good or bad, especially since the Knicks had a big man logjam as it is. Plus rose walks and that's a good thing. By the way, Holiday is a stud.
What makes Knicks fans what Phil gone is not what's going on with Melo, it's his infatuation with the triangle and his remarkes in the closing press conference that he was going to actively become more invovled with coaching the triangle. That's not how a president of basketball operations runs a fucking team if he's not the coach and it screams to NBA players, fans, staff, media, etc. as a clown show and I can bet you that Hornecek will not last under that guise and so that will be the 3rd coach that's fired under Phil in not even a complete 5 seasons.",0

3. For each sentence your technique constructs, find the corresponding sentence by matching on the position of the first token.
4. Define a sentence as correctly segmented if the position of the last tokens matches up.
4. Rinse and repeat to count correctly segmented sentences. 
I'm not a sentence segmentation expert so there may be better (or at least more standard) approaches in the literature. This method at least resolves the ""sentence shift"" problem you described.",0

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2fac7ec062b143e5a39467e9deb0fa09.png)  
&gt; Tone Tank tried to be normal. He tried to live a normal life. He had moved from Brooklyn, where he was born, to sunny Phoenix, Arizona. He bought a house, moved in with his girlfriend and their two dogs, and there may have even been a fence of the picket variety.
&gt; But the Gods of fate and the whim of the universe had other plans in store for young Tone. His girlfriend left him, he lost his job, and his house burned down, all in the span of a single month.
&gt; So Tone calls up his old friend Krayo. Krayo tells Tone that this must be a sign from above. The Great-What-Have-You is telling you to return home to Brooklyn for you are too ILL and there is much art to be made.
&gt; Kray was putting the final touches on Nuclear Family's debut EP “The New Singles” (2004 Ruffnoxious). Junk Science had started recording ""Feeding Einstein"" (2005 Embedded). After failing miserably at school and getting fired from his dead-end job that he didn’t even like, Kray found himself waking up each morning with desperation in his gut. That’s when Tone showed up with the U-Haul.
&gt; They lived in an industrial building set up as a bunker-style compound. They moved in fellow Nuk Fam members Probe &amp; Scott Thorough, along with two Pit Bulls, a Rottweiler, a palm tree, and a rotating cast of junkies, runaways, and roustabouts. They made an album. Tone and Kray that is.
&gt; “Iller Than Theirs” was produced almost entirely by N.E.M.C., who oversaw the project and ran the studio. Snafu of Junk Science dropped by to contribute beats and get busy with the cuts. Scott Thorough came out of his room to donate beats and vocals. Cool Calm Pete casually strolled in, kicked the dogs of the couch, and kicked a few rhymes. Jah-C from The Project (Glow in the Dark Records) popped in with some piff from uptown. And at one point, Masta Ace even magically appeared (poof?).
&gt; And through all of this, Kray &amp; Tone Tank assembled their statement of being. ILLER THAN THEIRS is a reaction to all things bloated &amp; phony, boring &amp; corporate, fancy &amp; fashioned, dead &amp; robotic. It is a barroom-brawl of a record, honestly eccentric, wildly colored and just a little bit ILLER than the rest of y’all. Read more on Last.fm.

"This is an interesting question. What do you mean by viable? If by viable you mean, ""does it give you a similar chance of winning as other proven archetypes,"" then no. Token decks have many more problems against the field of T1 decks than something like Jund.
However, if you mean, ""does this deck have a reasonable chance of victory against most decks in the field"" then yes token decks are viable. You can sit down and hope to win some matches with a token deck. At the very least, white gives good sideboard options.
Let's look at BW Tokens. It's a strong ""fair"" deck with life gain, flyers, and hand disruption.

Painting isn't required, I would suggest if you go this route to not put the board in tight between the door and deck, I would say leave it off the decking maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 inch to allow for the board to expand in warm weather. I personally try to avoid doing siding under a door like that, it's an area that can get damaged more easily and it can be difficult with not a lot of experience. ",0

I'm pretty sure that ""heterosexuality does not include trans women and men"" (which is basically what was said in different words) means trans women and trans men are in fact not ""real"" men and women, which is why I called it prejudice against trans people. 

My initial post assumed that everything about the trans woman was physically the same as a cis woman, the only variable changed was the trans part, so I don't get why you bring up genetalia at all. If the ONLY thing bothering you is the trans part that's clearly you having some kind of problem with trans people (or a phobia for genitial surgeries, but let's be real, that's not what's bothering most people, it's the fact that the woman was born with a penis).

"""Indiana has approved ""The First Church of Cannabis"" under its controversial religious freedom law.""
Really?  Where under this law is there an ""approval process"" for religions?
The fellow started a ""church"" on Facebook.   Indiana has not ""approved"" it from what I can read in the article or research online.
The law does not have a vetting or approval process, nor is any state agency authorized or been created to vet or ""approve"" religions.
The law applies only once you are sued in court, when a Judge must consider your religious rights.
So, once this guy gets busted for pot, he can argue the case to a Judge.  Somehow, I doubt an Indiana Judge is going to go along with this, however.
Being registered as a non-profit organization is NOT a part of the religious freedom act, nor does it affect the ""church's"" standing in view of the religious freedom act.

"hi there. im currently thinking about building a pc with similar characteristics. generally speaking mindfactory has the best prices when you are building in germany.
you can save some on the psu since youll most likely not need the wattage youre at right now and btw corsairs cx dont hold up with good psus. for the same price or even a little lower you can get a nice 400w-500w seasonic psu.
from personal experience those 120gigs on the ssd fill up rather quickly. you can go for a 240gb one for just a little more and ditch the hdd for now and put it in later.
as we are on the ""putting in stuff later thought"". you should really wait for the gpu market to settle after the release of amds highly anticipated cards as they should force down nvidias prices considerably as well.",0

I'm also not huge on the fact that, as laws are, they can break confidentiality when you seem suicidal. That's almost all the time for me. If I can't confide that in them, its pointless for me. Good therapists are REALLY hard to come by and hard to identify even when you do find one. I don't really have the time, energy, or money to find one. The last therapist I saw I wasted half a year and thousands of dollars on until I realized they weren't a good fit. I don't really have that kind of time to waste.

By withdrawing the endorsement *now*, he's basically just putting party over country again, since Trump is already losing so he can get back some dignity (read: votes) without sacrificing his party.

"Thinking about Memory.. 
Funny enough a few years ago I came across this video..although this doesn't seem to be like the full clip i originally saw. I found it really fascinating. After watching episode two I realized I was just getting a taste of Elizabeth Loftus's work.   

https://outlook.office365.com/owa/#path=/mail
 
I find it kind of concerning to think about the cases in which this ""guide imagination"" or really memory manipulation can happen to people who are unaware, not in a study, and maybe not as self confident. I would be an easy way to make some one vulnerable. And place in memories that could possible make a person think differently about themselves and their personality.  
   Kind of like John Vokey talked about the pastor and how it was fair to be worried about the idea for teens being unable to identify the source and then think it is themselves. 
I also think its interesting to think about the fact that you can add in memories and people believe them and are passionate about them but no one really agrees that you can ever really get rid of memories, for example traumas and things like that. Is it like not being able to unsee the dalmatian? ",0

First one was before I started smoking, I slide off the road and hit a tree while trying to perform a tokyo drift. Second was after I quit, I was raging angry at the world and ran a red light. Everyone is different. Had marijuana been legal to use while driving, I probably would never have had a single accident. I also think speeding should be legal.

"Three students aged 13-17 at a middle/high school in my area stole three cars, using the gas to get far as possible in each one and then stealing the next. They made it to Vegas before being caught. 

The parents of one of the children actually had the nerve to say, ""they should only be charged for stealing the first two cars because the third one's brakes didn't work."" 

This kind of stupidity terrifies me. And it's rampant. 

**EDIT:** speculate away. But no, this wasn't something said in order to bring the charges down. Kid is still in jail. They charged him as an adult. 

Listen, I'm all for rehabilitation. I really am. But you don't know these people. I do. So cool it with the assumptions. 

I understand your fervor, but these are kids who have had constant run-ins with the law. They're involved with drugs and with weapons. And not the good drugs. Try meth. 

The amount of pity for these kids is too high in this thread. Yeah some good kids make mistakes. But the problem kids also do, and much more frequently. 

And all of that aside. Why the fuck would anyone think that type of request was reasonable. No judge is going to ever go ""brake issues? Strike one of those grand theft autos from the record please.""

What kind of fucking logic is that? I can't believe you are trying to equate ""kids make mistakes"" to fucking 3 counts of grand theft auto. 

He's 17 fucking years old. Old enough to know that stealing cars is wrong. And like I said. This is **not** an isolated incident. ",0

"At level 35 you need to have the regular Basteer weapon in your inventory and talk to your Black Spirit to get the follow up quest. Warehouse will not work.
You need to upgrade to the Ultimate Basteer. The quest involves putting a special ""Weapon Stone (Basteer)"" into the weapon, and when instructed to remove it again using Extraction at the blacksmith. This will destroy the original Basteer but the quest completion will reward the Ultimate Basteer.
 
Then at level 48 you need to have the Ultimate Basteer in your inventory and talk to your Black Spirit to unlock the For a Sharper Weapon questline. 
After completing the last killquest (involves killing an Ogre) you need to upgrade Ultimate Basteer +7 and have it in your inventory, then talk to your Black Spirit. The final quest will lead you to Calpheon where you can trade in the Ultimate Basteer +7 for the Bares +7 and 5 more weaponstones.

"OOC: Well, both have CF. They met in the Hospital when both had lung infections. Seo and Rei were the only two with CF and the only two on their floor that were even close to the same age. CF patients are dangerous to each other. They can get infections that only other CF patients have and can get. Meaning if they even breath the same air it's dangerous. Rei being Rei she doesn't care. Seo being Seo cares immensely but his personality makes him accepting no matter the consequences. Rei became attached because he accepted her when she was weak. They go into it one day about their life goals. Rei want to live an action filled life and die before CF takes her. Seo wants to live a steady and long life while he works to fund a cure for CF. VERY different goals and ideas. She pushed too hard, tried to kiss Seo, and promptly called him a coward who would die with a fruitless life on his hands for not living in the moment. ",0

"after consulting with the rest of CCD, the following has be decided: 

* While your character has hacking ability, we feel that your characters focus on B&amp;E as opposed to actual decking does not qualify for a quality of that karmic magnitude (aka that much karma) *that* specific to decking.  You will need to replace Codeblock with another quality.

* The specialty in 'controlled explosions' (while creative) will not be accepted as a very large majority (practically all of them, which is beyond the spirit of a specialization) of uses for the explosives skill are *technically* a controlled explosion.  +5 internet points for cleverness though^no-actual-value.  If your goal is to gain access by blowing off doors, 'Breaching' would be how to go about that. 

_____

To your new question:

* Magic is a perfectly valid phobia.  Magic is also disproportionately represented on the hub (by which I mean its *supposed* to be super rare by lore but is also on like every run on the hub) so based on the lore presented in the books I would think Magic is *intended* to be an Uncommon Phobia.  But again, since runnerhub has a huge collection of Awakened (debatably in excess to lore averages) I can easily follow the logic that Magic would be Common Phobia as well, and would allow either option for this character at press time, based solely on the prolific amount of awakened currently around.  In either event, (I may be misunderstanding your intent here, so I added this just in case) it will *not* enable you to 'geek the mage' most of the time (in theory) because *failing* the composure roll will cause you to be terrified (which is both an RP and Mechanical detriment appropriate to the situation as defined by the GM) which makes it doubtful shooting at whatever sets the phobia off will be your response.  This negative does not allow for the concept of ['powering through the fear like Forrest Witiker'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8_oqrr04nY) or other forms of spraying lead at the thing that scares you (like in many horror movies) ***unless*** you succeed the composure roll first (Forrest the clip is *suceeding* a phobia roll to do all that) at which point 'powering through the fear' like in the movies is *exactly* what your doing.  

* The hub requires a little blurb about each contact relating to how they know you, what they do for you, and some kinda RP angle for the GM to work with (can be as simple as 'ditzy valley girl') which should be a few sentences at most.

* Carjacking is harder than it sounds in the 6th world, but more to the point the hub does not allow *looting* of any sort unless it is a 'Prime Run', which will be marked as such.  That doesnt mean *stealing* a car is not allowed, but keeping a stolen one (and the resulting process of reestablishing ownership) past the immediate need (read: the job you are on at the time) is not gonna be a thing.  Stealing one for a job is harder than it sounds though.

There's always another one around the corner, but when we find one we like enough, and that likes us back, we stop there because it's good enough. Not because we think the fates conspired to finally put you and the only person you're meant to be with together.

"Seeing that other people put their short reviews, I will too. Warning, long list. These are all my first impressions of the winter animes that I've watched. These are all for the episode one of the series.
**Absolute Duo** A harem anime, with action. Your average anime, but it was surprisingly enjoyable in my opinion; I wasn't expecting to like it. I'll definitely be sticking with it. It's not the most original story, but I like it. 7.7/10. My unpopular opinion? It's better than Shinmai and World Break.   
**Assassination Classroom** It's strange, but worth watching. It had a nice start, and I'm interested to see how it will end. I recommend it, 8/10. (I thought the main character was a girl for 13 minutes though.)   
**Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!** I'm actually very surprised that it's rated so low. It's a parody of magic girl animes, and is funny at times. It makes fun of itself as well, with some amusing jokes (such as Random splash attack!) for their own attacks. It's going to be a ride. 7.4/10.   
**Death Parade** Very similar to its prequel, Death Billiards, which I also recommend watching. I'm not sure how I feel about the opening. It's going to be dark, and I think it will make you think about the characters' motives or why they went to where they go (reincarnation or the void). The next episode seems to be world building, like other people have mentioned. 8/10, I recommend it. I think it will end up as an 8.3/10.  
**Doamaiger D** You know, I was looking forward to this. I'm unsure why there aren't any english subs out for this yet, so I had to watch it in raw. Anyways, it has a 70s style, but it seems very fast paced. I like Daijirou's voice though, as well as the song that plays. It's only about 3 minutes long, and I wish it had more potential. It's okay I suppose.   
**Kantai Collection: KanColle** Overall, a 7/10. It has a Strike Witches feel to it, although I haven't even seen that anime. I do like some characters though, especially [Yuudachi](http://myanimelist.net/character/111287/Yuudachi) and [Nagato](http://myanimelist.net/character/111289/Nagato).  
**Rolling Girls** I think a lot of people though this would be an adventure anime with girls on bikes or motorcycles. I was very wrong. It had some interesting colorful action that I was not expecting. 7.3/10.  
**World Break: Aria of Curse for a Holy Swordsman** Warning, unpopular opinion. I honestly did not like this anime. There were a lot of animation issues, and I really did not like Satsuki. They repeated the same song (that I also didn't like) three times (or at least so I heard), but, I did like the battle music. I cringed at the 'incest' part of it. I don't have much hopes for it.  
**Sengoku Musou** My plan for the winter season was to watch every anime that looked even a little bit interesting. I don't know much about the series, so I wasn't a fan of this anime. I thought it was boring, but then again, I may not like Samurai animes. 6/10.  
**The Testament of Sister New Devil** I forgot what it was about, and went into it blind. At first, I thought it was going to be an ecchi incest (well, not technically), and oh boy, am I glad I was wrong. I was very surprised at seeing magic. 7/10 so far. Better than world break in my opinion. I like the main character's design though.  
**The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls** I haven't seen any iDOLM@STER animes just as a heads up. I liked Rin and the producer. 7/10, not much to say about it.  
**Yoru No Yatterman** I'm pleased with it. Although it has a slow start, I recommend watching it. It definitely has potential. 8/10.  
**Yuri Kuma Arashi** Being serious, I haven't seen any of Ikuhara Kunihiko's works. I'm not a fan of this anime because I did not enjoy the art style, and it just seemed so odd. I had to keep making sure I wasn't watching a hentai too. Although I'm still going to be watching it, I think its ratings will be overall low compared to other animes. If you're still wondering about it, check out the episode.  
**How to raise a boring girlfriend** I actually have high hopes for this. I was *not* expecting to like this anime much. The art is pretty, and it was overall enjoyable. 8/10.  
Best first episode? Probably Death Parade.
Show that isn't getting enough attention? Yoru no Yatterman.  
Didn't live up to the hype? Probably Yuri Kuma Arashi.  ",0

If someone does something wrong. They go to prison until they are deemed to no longer be a danger to society or have served a term proportional to the harm they committed. A hallmark of our legal system is that all are equal before the law. This legislation (which almost certainly will be struck down as unconstitutional) provides a penalty that is not available to those who only have Canadian citizenship (the government can't revoke citizenship if it would make someone stateless). It clearly creates two classes of citizenship - those whose citizenship is absolute, and those whose citizenship is conditional upon good behaviour. 
Another thing to consider. No justice system is perfect. Our courts can and do make mistakes, and convict people for crimes they did not commit. The law also allows for revocation if someone was convicted of ""an offence outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would constitute a terrorism offence"". Not every country has the same due process as we do, rules regarding the collection of evidence, or the same prohibitions against torture and cruel and unusual punishment as we do. 
Someone wrongfully convicted and stripped of their citizenship could have a very real chance of being sent off to a country to which they have little knowledge of or connection to, where they could be at serious risk of injury or death.",0

"Solo Lobby is critical unless you can get into a PCEO/Cartel/Friendly Lobby crew, because then you reap the public lobby bonus without the threat. 

Next step is factoring in what Vehicles you are given.

- Any Plane mission is worth considering a reboot (close the app, you should only lose 1-3 crates, rebuy and try a sell again. If you decide you attempt them, you will want to scout the delivery route/delivery destination for enemies with your Buzzard beforehand. Once you trigger and destroy the enemies they will not come back and you should have a threat-free flight.)

- Trucks are easy as shit. Cross your fingers that you get them, then just make the multiple trips. If you get the one where you have to defend the cargo from NPCs at the delivery point, I would recommend bringing your heaviest armed Pegasus and/or CEO vehicles to protect you, the cargo, and offer you some heavier weaponry. (if you own both, bring the Insurgent Pickup from Pegasus, and spawn your CEO Turreted Limo; two armed and armored barricades.)

- If you get the Tug you will either have to kill enemies at the dock to get onto the Tug and then shouldnt have any more NPCs on the ride out, or you will have a few waves of boat and chopper NPCs come after you. If it is the latter, just head out onto the deck of the Tugboat as soon as you see the red NPC icons and dispose of them, then keep moving. Alternatively, try hiring the Backup Helicopter from Merryweather; it is pretty effective against NPCs",0

Even if you have a bad game there's still 3 other guys that can carry. My Claudette? Max level speed burst / self healing / botany / x. I haven't played survivor since DS but with that in there I'd say survivorperks are pretty strong wouldn't you?
I believe you when you say you 4 manned without perks but not against a decent (SWF) R1 team. Play perkless on Rank 1 against any SWF and you will get shit on hands down (maybe the odd skillbilly on cornfield will get you 2 kills if you are lucky). The problem with killers is that Killers have very little choice. We absolutely NEED Iron Grasp or Agitation (maybe not anymore because of slugmeta but that's even worse), if you don't play nurse you simply NEED Brutal Strength. There's 2 perks used for perks that are boring as fuck. 
Survivors don't need SB to be viable but it's a great perk and it's fun to have. You can do without selfcare but it's pretty damn nifty when you want to run with something other than a healthkit. You wouldn't need DS either, but it's so retardedly OP that you'd be an idiot if you didn't. ",0

"I'm actually being serious... There was forced sterilization for criminals, and I do think it was America that did it.

edit: [I was right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization#By_country)

&gt;The United States was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.^^[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization#cite_note-38) The heads of the program were avid believers in eugenics and frequently argued for their program.

&gt;After World War II, public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany, though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. The Oregon Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983,[50] with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.

And theres still shit going on with it more recently:

&gt;As of January 2011, discussions were underway regarding compensation for the victims of forced sterilization under the authorization of the Eugenics Board of North Carolina. Governor Bev Perdue formed the NC Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation in 2010 in order ""to provide justice and compensate victims who were forcibly sterilized by the State of North Carolina"".[54] In 2013 North Carolina announced that it would spend $10 million beginning in June 2015 to compensate men and women who were sterilized in the state's eugenics program; North Carolina sterilized 7,600 people from 1929 to 1974 who were deemed socially or mentally unfit.[55]

In my country there are a huge amount of Chinese immigrants and businesspeople and speaking Chinese could definitely be useful for establishing business connections, though probably not required.  Nevertheless, I'd imagine it might give you a leg up when competing for business.

To be honest I think the biggest benefit to Chinese is still the ""chic factor"".  When you tell someone you speak Chinese, they tend to react like ""whoa!  holy shit!"" in a way that they wouldn't if you said you spoke Spanish or French or something.

I watched him try to cheat someone at SCG Worchester a while back. Gerard had upticked his Ashiok against his B/R Dragons opponent in the feature match area, exiling Kolaghan the Storm's Fury.
On his next turn, he read Ashiok, read Kolaghan, re-read Ashiok, re-read Kolaghan, then used Ashiok's -X ability to put Kolaghan into play and attacked for 5.
He knew Ashiok didn't allow him to cast the Kolaghan for its dash cost, but he double and triple checked and went for it anyways hoping his opponent wouldn't notice the interaction. His opponent didn't notice, but the judges were alerted quickly enough to back it up.

"But then you have the sets, which affect your ability to move farther with tap damage. Normally, that would tie into gold because sets affect Hero DPS but the model of efficiency we're targeting right now is the amount of hero levels you can amass. If you focus on gold, you can bypass some deficiencies in pushing whether that comes from tap or lack of sets because you're bringing the gold values closer to you at earlier stages. 

The same roll-back doesn't exactly apply with tap damage because of the tie-in to sets. Not sure if that makes sense.

That's true. DmgE has been defacto ruler for some time. Once I get UA up, I'll probably go tap for weekdays and gold for weekends. Or I could focus in bulk on one category to see what seems to help more for Mon. tournaments if you want. Given that it seems like I need 500 UA minimum to be effective and I haven't hit 400 yet, that could be awhile -_-

We already know we're getting a Dragon flying-mount and flying Black Chocobo, and the Griffon is the Collector's Edition mount.
Honest guess? I'm thinking it will be a Tiger of some kind (Lions, and Tigers, and Bears? Oh my!). However, seeing as the Dark Knight is the new kid on the block, I think it's totally possible they might get a flying mount, and in that case, I'm thinking perhaps something akin to Doom Gaze, from Final Fantasy VI.

"As someone who comes from a broken home this is exactly how I feel. My SO and I have been together a few years now, but I made the conscious decision to commit to him pretty soon after we first met and I take that commitment seriously. I have found that when we're going through a rough patch it is usually caused by internal issues that we're not discussing with each other. Admittedly, I can be very stubborn and sometimes have to remind myself to put my stubbornness aside for the sake of our relationship. At the end of the day, I am incredibly lucky to come home to my best friend every day. He is 100% accepting of me and there for me no matter what in a way that nobody else ever has been and that's worth more than words can convey. When we do have disagreements or go through issues in our relationship I try to take it as a learning exercise that strengthens our relationship. After every fight, we are still there for one another and that's what's important. It's easy to push other people away to protect yourself, but I have come to realize that in hurting my partner I am always hurting myself, as well. If we get married one day, I think we'll have a much stronger marriage for having worked through issues together and supporting one another. For me, that's so crucial because my parents hated each other when I was growing up. I never want my children to have to go through that, wondering if with every fight we might split up.

"The biggest problem I have with these episodes is that they will add more depth to these characters. I feel the characters were underdeveloped or simply not examined enough in the core game. Thus if I am to sympathise and connect with these characters, I am required to buy this dlc. The lack of emotional attachment to these characters ruined the narrative for me, especially the ending.
The other problem is that they cover essential aspects of the characters in these episodes: Gladios's scar and how he mourned Jared, Ignis and how he lost his sight and Prompto and his dad. If these were but small additions of the characters then I would have no problem with it, but the game acts as if these elements are essential to the characters, for example:
- Ignis looses his sight, but Prompto and gladio are unscratched. After this event the game tries to really make the player sympathetic towards Ignis(which it suceeds in doing for some) but for me, this section is really badly placed. What could possibly fix this for me is seeing exactly how he lost his sight. 
-Prompto just suddenly say he's a MT which just comes out of nowhere, the only use for this moment is to reassure the player about one thing we have already seen in the game: ""They are good friends"", when it clearly has a deeper story behind it, one they chose to cut out and tell us later
-Gladios episode is actually a little less obvious, I don't really know exactly what will be covered here but I am guessing we will get a chance to see the narrative trough his eyes. We might also finally get to know why Jareds death was sad...
These episodes are all appearently occurring during the games timeline and it feels cheap, it feels like the narrative was designed just to sell these episodes later... If they were to make these episodes acceptable, in my oppinion, they would have these episodes play out AFTER the game ended, which is a problem since the designer decided to have an ""open"" ending or before the game opens(ie. a proper opening, which should've been in the game to begin with).
alternatively I think I would be okay with an episode about side characters during the narrative, but this is questionable
TL;DR The narrative occuring during the games main storyline should be in the game. Extra episodes should be put outside the scope of the game or be free as they serve not to add extra information about the world but to cover crutial development of its characters.",0

"I think you mean half a century, not half a decade.

And no, there is obviously conflict because people have been shot for that idea.  It's fucked up and evil, but ignoring it is not going to fix the problem.  All that will do is breed resentment, and they and their children will feel vindicated through what they think of as 'censorship' or 'oppression' - and that's how you breed more racists.  

If you think the race-based shootings are anywhere approximating the severity of racial violence in past years, you are very much mistaken.  It's tragic, but lynchings/shootings/beatings of minorities are also a hell of a lot less common now than they used to be during Jim Crow.  Why do you think that is?  Our culture has shifted.  How?  Because progressives came into constant ideological conflict with conservatives, and over a period of decades, won hearts and minds.  That's how we started making progress, it's how we keep making progress today, and it's how we'll end it.

"Similarly for the past month I've been drinking Coffiest in the morning and making a powder meal for lunch after easing my body into it. Started when coworker gave me a bag of Soylent to try out, and although the taste is nothing to brag about, I was amazed at how well it satisfied my hunger and kept me full for 4-5 hours. When I ordered Coffiest I experienced the same thing, only I now never crave morning coffee. My experience is very close to the poster above, so I'll try to just add my differences.
Taste: The Coffiest tastes like chocolate milk to me, the powder is between nothing and a thin pancake powder, I make it in a blender bottle with 1 ice cube and have no complaints.
Price: I buy 2 of the Coffiest a month, and 1 or less of the powder. At most this comes to $130 a month. This is astronomically less than I would spend on breakfast and lunch prior to soylent. I was easily spending $30 a day on those two, and grossly overeating at the same time.
Unexpected bonus: I only realized once I made it a routine, but I had a lot of subtle anxiety about finding breakfast and lunch before Soylent. Now it's really comforting to know that I have a healthier breakfast and lunch every day.
I do eat a normal meal for dinner, and cook normal meals on the weekend, and I think that helps in not feeling too monotonous as well as keeping that social interaction of eating. ",0

"Yes, I'll probably be buying it. Reordering on Amazon Prime gets you 20% off, which is great.
**However**, the tech test was pretty disappointing all around, and I don't have high hopes for it. As stated so many times on this sub and r/titanfall, many of the changes are simply confounding. Larger issues like not having bots in modes and not debuting with classics like LTS and Attrition, as well as a drastic shift in map design (more the rural one than the urban one, that one was alright), and the mind boggling removal of Titan shields, to smaller, but still very important issues like the horrible 3rd person animations and lack of titan weapon/ability customization, it really feels like Respawn was trying to go in a completely random direction.
It's most disappointing because TF2 seems like a shoe-in. These are the guys that brought us MW2, one of the funnest, most ambitious, yet simple in concept sequels in gaming history; the game that changed very little, but added everything, which is exactly what people seemed to want from TF1. ""Hey, that TF1 was fucking amazing, it'd be great if you make a big budget sequel where you just add a shit ton of content"". Boom. Done.
I will admit there were things I liked about TF2, but even these things compromised aspects of the first. I like the snappier, more tight gunplay, but that's partially due to the faster TTK. I like the health bars, but they take away from the feel of the game. I like the idea of the themed titans, but they take away from the strategy and endless customizability. I like the grappling hook, but I also want stim. I like the way the rural map felt like a big battlefield and evoked a natural sense of scale that was unseen in TF1, yet it had almost no coherent pilot combat.
Most of all, it feels like the lost sight of the game's central goal; to create a nonstop, immersive, seamless stream of action. Watch the E3 t trailer from 2013. Why would anyone, at any time in the pipeline, sugggest taking out 1st person animations? Who thought those needed to change? Who thought that taking out the ability to ride enemy titans for an extended period of time was a good idea?
It's amusing to me that CoD:IW seems to be pleasing their fans better at this point, with a prime example being their class system. They didn't throw out the 3 perk slots or make it so weapons are mapped to archetypes like Titans in TF2, they just added something to an already successful system.
I'll be buying the game because Respawn has been superb at supporting TF1, and I trust their good intent. I want TF as a franchise to succeed, and TF2 failing doesen't accomplish anything. Yes, I understand people wanting to send the message that they don't like their game, but if you like TF as a whole, then TF2 needs all the help it can get to get passing sales, not flop, and doom the changes of another game. Also, 50 dollars for a game that I'll get at least some amusement out of isn't some kind of horrible deal.",0

"You can't be serious? To what extent? The whole notion is completely insane. You could take every single pro athlete in America and make them train soccer for a year and not a single one who doesn't have a soccer background would even make the US National team, let alone be the best in the world. Size and strength are NOWHERE near as important in Soccer as Basketball or American football. 
Usain Bolt has played a lot of soccer in his life and is a fan of the sport. He is pretty much as good of an athlete as it goes and yet looks like an amateur when he plays. Because that's what he is.
The level of competition worldwide in soccer is on a completely different level to any of the top three American sports. There are almost as many registered footballers as there are people in the US (and a few billion unregistered). If you haven't played it since you were a kid, you simply can't become that good.

I had a GF who insisted on a regiment of testing. Everyone was tested in alternating cycles. It was every 6 months but each test was offset by 3 months. So I was tested 3 months after her and she was tested 3 months after me. 
It worked well, at one point her other boyfriend's other girlfriend popped up with an STI. His other GF tested positive, he tested positive, my GF tested positive, I tested negative. So it worked well for me. lol",0

He emphasized the importance of not taking part in these, and shared the story of one boy who had work experience at a garage.  He was given an initiation that involved putting an air hose into his underwear, which 'somehow' found it's way to his anus, and blew out all of his insides with the high pressure air.
I never really believed the story, but he finished it by saying how glad he was to be able to tell us it was the only fatal accident during work experience while he was Headmaster.  That was a weird fucking school, and he was the icing on the cake.",0

"I have a few things for you to consider. First, the job market sucks. Period. I know its tough to see other people get the ""good"" jobs, but there could be a huge list of reasons they got them. Maybe they just knew someone with an in. Maybe they had a really great interview and just got all the right questions that they could answer. Maybe that company was just looking for one specific thing that a single person may have had. I have struggled because employers in my area hate to hire local people, they all want to pull from a neighboring state because the grass is always greener. I have a job that isn't my dream job, but I still have one. 

Is 33K a year enough for you to live on? I know its not much, but its a living for a starting position. Build up that experience over a year or two and keep interviewing. Something else will come along eventually whether you expect it or not. 

Its a little cheesy, but money doesn't buy happiness. Sometimes I fantasize about having a job that isn't so high stress, even if it paid considerably less. I have friends who are extremely unhappy in their relatively high paying jobs. 

Lastly, I am currently struggling to imagine staying in one job for more than a few years. I love change and new environments. Maybe it isn't such a bad thing to look forward to an upgrade. If you learn to save wisely on 33K, imagine how responsible you will be with 68K. 

Hope that helps!",0

"Despite what has been said elsewhere, Jock Stein initially accepted the offer of a seat on the board of directors, a position to be ratified at the formality of an AGM later that year: ""The job became a bit more difficult recently when I couldn't get about the field as much as I'd have liked. **I'm more than happy to be going on to the Board.**""(Daily Record: 1 June 1978). At a press conference held at Parkhead to announce the changes, the chairman insisted that the former manager would be welcomed because ""his name can open many doors and attract many ideas from many directions"". From Campbell &amp; Woods ""DREAMS &amp; SONGS TO SING"" a history of Celtic.
Much was made of the fact that Stein, a non-Catholic, had been appointed to the Board of Directors but there does not seem to have been anymore reason why he should not have been than there was any reason for not making him manager 13 years before. What is certain is that Stein no sooner accepted the post than he began to have second thoughts...**""I did not want to stay with Celtic as a director. I felt I had too much to offer football and I wanted closer involvement"".** From Bob Crampsey ""Mr. Stein"" A Biography.
At the same board meeting at which it was agreed to pursue Jock Stein's recommendation of McNeill as manager...an apparently handsome offer was made to the outgoing manager. The minutes record:
**In view of Mr Stein's long and valued service with the club, it was agreed that at the time a new manager was appointed, Mr Stein be offered an executive directorship with the club as recognition and compensation by the club for these services. Mr Stein indicated that he would be very pleased to accept such a directorship which, presuming Mr Stein accepted the Celtic job, would take effect at the time of the club's next AGM.** From Brian Wilson ""CELTIC a century with honour"".

I'm from South Louisiana. Maybe 3 hours at least from New Orleans. Our town wasn't hit bad for Katrina. Standard hurricane stuff. Lights out, heat, guzzling water and waiting for news. But Katrina impacted our states psychology for sure.
  I was about 12 when it happened. Just turned it actually and my Granny,God rest her soul, owned the community store at the time. We always had people come through. With a small National Guard more in town. We had heard stories. Well, my mom and dad didn't want us to hear it but we did anyway.
  We heard a lot of horror. Survivors shooting each other, dead bodies being loaded into 18 wheelers and sent off to Texas for whatever reasons. Rape, death, hurting at every corner. Even a myth of the Sharks from the Audubon Aquarium escaping. It was then I learned that humanity can turn savage in an instant. How do you tell children who try to make sense of these things that this happened after a disaster?
  I feel for y'all. I had family out there helping. They still say it was the worst thing ever seen. And New Orleans is a haunted city. A cesspool that never learned.

Your question has been removed because it's not specific enough.
**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**
We **LOVE** questions - we really do! - but help request posts are only appropriate if you have a *specific* question about an *aspect* of a DIY project. Questions should include a description of the project you want to do, and details of what you need help with. Include photos if you can.
This subreddit is about HOW to do things. If your question can't be reduced to a sentence that starts with the word ""How"", then it probably doesn't belong here.
The following types of questions aren't allowed here - if your post contains any of the following, that's probably why it was removed:
1. asking for aesthetic judgments (i.e., what color to paint something, whether something would look ""good"")
2. asking *whether* you should do a project
3. asking ""Has anyone built anything like X?""
4. asking how to ""get started"" on a project
5. asking if a project is ""easy""
6. asking which way to approach a project would be best
7. asking ""What should I make?""
8. asking ""What's the best way to make X?""
9. asking ""Does anyone have any ideas for?""
10. asking ""Where can I buy a _____?""
11. asking ""What is this thing called?""
12. asking ""How do I get started with _______?""
13. asking ""Does anyone have any links?""
14. asking ""Has anyone ever used/made X?""
You have a few options:
1. If you have a project in mind, do some research, put together a basic plan for your project, and re-post a specific question about your project. Your question should describe what you want to accomplish, what you have researched, and a specific question about HOW to accomplish it. If you can re-word your question so that it starts with the word ""how"", it's probably OK here.
2.  **If appropriate, please repost your question in the stickied [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY.** It's a weekly thread intended for more general questions. It's usually very active, and you will probably get some answers.
3. Post your question in another subreddit, such as /r/HomeImprovement, /r/woodworking, /r/whatisthisthing, etc.
We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.
The Moderators are human, just like you, and sometimes we make mistakes. If you believe that the removal or your post is a mistake, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY&amp;subject=Specific%20questions). Thank you.",0

"For the home vs renting argument, landlords are constantly raising rents whereas mortgage payments stay much more stable. On the job locations thing, this is why I would never buy a home, on the constantly rising rents, this is why I will never rent again. 
Re the illegals argument, harsh treatment on illegals was tried a few years back in one of the southern states, so they lost anyone who was going to pick crops. No whites stepped in to fill those below minimum wage jobs and crops rotted in the fields and those who supported such idiotic measures saw millions in profits disappear for their constituents who owned those farms. They decided to change the laws back to something less punishing.
Meanwhile, those 'illegals' were flown to farms in Canada and picked those crops there and still sent money back home to Mexico.
RE H1b visa workers, well when the conservative controlled government undermines education, games the college loan system and otherwise cripples any chance of anyone getting an education then employers have no choice except to bring in H1B workers. I'm one of those directly affected by those truly rudderless idiot decisions. . . 
What my solution is to fix this problem? Do as I do, don't rent anymore, live out of a van or minivan and convert that to a small RV. After a short while you get used to it and end up much happier  in the end. No loss of income to predatory landlords or mortgage agencies, money is now saved instead of wasted paycheck to paycheck. If enough people do this it's only a matter of time before this problem self corrects 'cause 'capitalism'. . (bullshit). . .
 
Meanwhile, I've got enough time now to devote to getting a better education out of my own pocket, no loans, then once I have a proper job where I can work remotely, save some more money, then off to Canada (more and more are pursuing this option) to work remotely while waiting to obtain Canadian citizenship. . .

"Before I dropped out of college, I was going to a university that had a *major* reputation of being a party school, to the point of having once been rated ""#1 Party School"" by Playboy or something to that effect.  Now, I didn't live on campus, so I avoided most of it just by being a commuter, but I still have a story about this:
All incoming freshmen had to attend a three-day (IIRC) orientation.  I had kind of a strange situation/case, as I had taken classes there as a dual-credit student in HS, and had amassed enough credit hours that *officially* I was coming in as a ""degree-seeking"" student as a sophomore, which allowed me to circumvent the requirement of living on campus for a semester, so I was relieved to think that I could get out of this also.  Nope, no such luck.  I played frustrating phone tag with the administration and vigorously pleaded my case every which way, to no avail.  They told me unequivocally and firmly that I would be required to attend this orientation.  ""But technically I'm a sophomore!"" I said.  ""But I'm not even going to live on campus!"" I pleaded.  They didn't care.
So I'm already in a sour mood going into this, and then I discover that it's mostly hours upon hours of alcohol education, for *multiple days in a row*.  Seriously, well over half the orientation was dedicated to alcohol.  They had cheesy, poorly-done scenario skits about sexual assault on alcohol that only served to severely muddle the issue, and they literally had presentations on what to do in the event of alcohol poisoning if someone started to turn various shades of different colors.  There was a brief talk about time management and campus resources, a quick safe-sex reminder that was totally heteronormative and as such didn't really apply to me anyway, and then alcohol this, booze that, drinking harm reduction the rest of the time.
I was *irked* to say the least.  Irate, even.  (I take prescription drugs on occasion now, but...) I really *was* a teetotaler then-- wasn't even prescribed psychiatric meds of any sort, and didn't touch psychoactive substances aside from caffeine at all.  Basically the whole orientation I was stupidly required to sit through was useless to me.  I realized shortly afterwards that this was probably all done for liability reasons--there had been *many* incidents of alcohol-related arrests, ridiculous shenanigans and a few poisoning deaths in recent years at the school, and I suppose they wanted to ensure that parents couldn't try to sue.
I'm all for harm reduction, but the whole thing inherently *assumed* that we would all be drinking at some point, and that we would all be doing so in the most irresponsible ways possible.  It probably even *encouraged* alcohol consumption as a result, it was over-the-top, and it shouldn't be required for students who don't even partake.",0

There also aren't any token matches - which is quite often a more silly side to the stream.

"OK, so the thing you have to understand is that Silverlight is based off an API from 1995, called NPAPI. NPAPI is not supported on Chromebooks, and as a result, Silverlight is not as well.
Most of the arguments you've seen in this thread about why Silverlight is bad is mostly a relic of the fact that it's based off said API. To put into perspective how relatively old it is, NPAPI actually stands for Netscape Plugin API.
NPAPI's entire point is that you can use it to load non-website files in your browser without loading a third party application. Things like video, audio, and programs in general. This is a massive security risk.
Now, granted, NPAPI has been beefed up in security since the 90s, but it's rather like trying to put a bucket under a roof leak. Sure, you no longer have water damage, but the current situation is only marginally better. 
ActiveX had similar goals and security issues, and was released in 1996, to put the kind of perspective deserved on this. NPAPI should have died a long time ago, scorned to the end, just like ActiveX.
As for 'major players' using it successfully, looking at some stats for Chrome users, we see the truth. Only 11% of Chrome users combined launched Silverlight at any point in the month. Next most popular is Google Talk at 7%, which has already switch to, iirc, WebRTC. After that is Java (3.7%), Facebook, (3.0%, no longer uses NPAPI), Unity plugin (1.9%) and finally Google Earth (.01%, no longer using NPAPI).
So Google is looking at this old, unsafe, horrific, legacy API that makes their engineers want to gouge their eyes out, and they look at the stats.
The top 6 uses of NPAPI, three of them were planned to be moved off NPAPI to HTML5/WebRTC/etc. That leaves Silverlight, Java, and Unity. Unity is actively trying to swap over to WebGL and has been for a while, though it hasn't succeeded yet and they won't for a while.
That pretty much leaves Java and Silverlight for Google to care about. I'll save you the discourse on why Java applets make me a sad man, and move onto Silverlight, which is pretty much the only big contender, mostly because of Netflix.
I'm about to blow your mind. Microsoft ended development of Silverlight back in 2012. MICROSOFT isn't even going to have Silverlight in their new browser, Edge.
Firefox, IE, and Safari have all ended support for NPAPI and/or Silverlight in some way, but they did it in a half-assed manner, using whitelists to keep certain major trusted programs like Netflix working.
Google is just the first to ditch their whitelist (which they had for iirc, a year).
tl;dr: This isn't a huge deal. Silverlight, as well as NPAPI (which it is based on) is old, tired, and a security risk. It's old software, it's deprecated, and what it tries to do is a security land mine in the first place. Support is ending across the board. It's not a huge deal, it's just how software works. 
Did Google jump the gun a little? Well, we're going to disagree here, because I feel like removing security risks is more important than a feature I don't use (I don't watch netflix on my computer, and my TV is 720p and I watch it on a Wii U anyway.).",0

"I already posted this over at r/spikes, but I figured I'd post it here as well.
&amp;nbsp;
Like everyone here, I've played this deck extensively, and after much trial and error, I've settled on what I believe is the most optimum version of the list. I'll do my best to explain reasoning for each card:
&amp;nbsp;
Main Deck (60)
&amp;nbsp;
Creatures: 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Embodiment of Spring. (Oddly enough this guy is an absolute monster. In the early testing of the deck, I really thought the plan was to ramp out as fast as possible while ignoring the board and pray that by time we're ready to 'combo off' we throw it out there in hopes that our opponent has no answer. The more I tested, I slowly learned that we interact with the board in very unique ways in hopes of luring our opponent into a false sense of confidence so they'll over extend to compensate. Having 4 of this guy allows us to not have to mulligan quite as aggressively because he buys us some time getting in the way of early aggro, gives us a better chance to get to our precious plains should we need to wrath, &amp; should it be unnecessary to crack him early on, he can thin out the late game library ridding us of of dead land draws.)
&amp;nbsp; 
Spells:
 
&amp;nbsp;
The ramp suite: 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Hedron Archive (great against control decks, we use these as early game ramp and late game card advantage when mana is no longer an issue) 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Explosive Vegetation (The great mana fixer. Explosive Vegetation really dictates the direction of our plays, it may seem pretty cut and dry,  but the lands we choose off this spell can make or break what we're able to do during the pivotal mid-game turns) 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Nissa's Renewal (It's been my experience that if we're able to fire one or two of these off, we've given ourselves the upper hand, doesn't necessarily win us the game, but it certainly gives us an advantage. At this point we should be able to fix any mana problems we might have.) 
&amp;nbsp;
The extra turns suite: 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Part the Waterveil (if you've sleeved up this deck you know that playing this card with its awakened cost likely means we're dealing a minimum of 12 damage. Though playing a smart early game will likely allow us to cast this card as the beginning of a chain of turns that'll win us the match. Rarely should this be cast without awaken, because if we're throwing it out these and reaching and hoping we get there, we've not done a good enough job in setting up the board for ourselves.) 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Temporal Trespass (The delve mechanic of this card makes it an absolute game clincher. Getting an extra turn for UUU is such a dirty play. Also worth noting that the full set of Embodiments also gives value to playing for delve. Ramping/mana fixing/filling the graveyard turns out is very good.) 
&amp;nbsp;
Wrath:
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Planar Outburst (A well timed Planar Outburst will often times put us in a position where our opponent will need to chase us a bit, when awakened, we'll get in for 4 damage and more often than not, draw out a removal spell that I am all to happy to see wasted.) 
&amp;nbsp;
Draw/Fix:
&amp;nbsp;
3 x Dig Through Time (almost exclusively we'll dig the same way a control player does, at the end of an opponents turn. This card grants insane card advantage and does strike some level of fear into our opponents. For this reason, I'll often use a Dig to draw out a counter spell. I don't like to reach with a Dig in hopes of hitting something good, I like to use it to take an already good hand and make it unbeatable.) 
&amp;nbsp;
3 x Taigam's Scheming (I know, I know... It doesn't seem good at all, but realistically this card plays in our deck like an all star. This card played on turn 2 does several invaluable things, 1: fixes our draws buy allowing us to step up the optimum series of turns. It does slow us down for a turn in our ramp strategy, but by willingly slowing ourselves rather than being made to slow down by our opponent, we can ensure our dream line of playing. If played following a turn 1 Embodiment, the slowing of a single turn isn't even all that bad. 2: It fills our Graveyard giving us an opportunity to play our huge value delve spells like Dig Through Time as early as turn 3. If I curve out in this way, Turn 1 Embodiment, Turn 2 Scheming, Turn 3 Dig, we have the potential to see 12 cards into our deck and should have a handle on the line of play were going to take and can do so confidently. I play this card in place of Rattle Claw Mystic, because I found that he is a prime target for removal and often times never sees the board long enough to tap for mana. I've not second guessed this decision since I've made it.) 
&amp;nbsp;
Planeswalkers:
&amp;nbsp;
2 x Ugin, the Spirit Dragon (I am pretty confident I don't need to list ALL the ways this guy is just plain ridiculous. The inclusion of Ugin gives us 2 more wrath effects against aggro, a very slow, but very effect alternate win condition against control decks by dealing 3 damage a turn,  3 damage a turn can also put us in better range to finish opponents off with Lumbering Falls if we don't get to our extra turn spells, and drawing 7 cards off of his ultimate will likely find us what we are looking for and let us dump onto the battlefield any lands we've just drawn/had sitting in our hand. 
&amp;nbsp;
Lands: (I've done a slight bit of tweaking on the mana base, but nothing too drastic)
&amp;nbsp; 
8 x Island (same as the original list)
&amp;nbsp; 
8 x Forest (I cut 2 Blighted Woodlands and put 2 forests in because it gives us a bit more value to our late game ramp spells giving us more basics to actually find, and by cutting the number of colorless lands down to 2 it makes the hands we should mulligan a lot clearer)
&amp;nbsp; 
3 x Plains (I did test adding a 4th but found that I was actually seeing them much more than I'd like to, so I went back down to 3 and just pay very close attention to when I should be using my ramp spells to grab them)
&amp;nbsp;
3 x Lumbering Falls (Depending on the match up, I will sometimes awaken onto this guy giving me the option of combat tricks essentially giving myself the option to bounce removal spells off of him by activating him in response or activating him in response to no blocks declared for an extra 3 damage. 
&amp;nbsp;
Sideboard: (What I've done for the board is I've put every possible deck to play against into 1 of 2 categories: Aggro or Control/Combo. I determine game 1 which category my opponents deck falls into and board accordingly the same way each time without fail.) 
&amp;nbsp;
4 x Jaddi Offshoot
&amp;nbsp;
3 x Hangarback Walker
&amp;nbsp;
3 x Winds of Qal
&amp;nbsp; 
3 x Dispel
&amp;nbsp;
2 x Negate
&amp;nbsp;
Aggro:
&amp;nbsp;
+4 Jaddi Offshoot (with ramp spells, this guy is absurd. Nissa's Renewal with a Jaddi on board nets us 10 life, 11 if we made our land drop that turn.) 
&amp;nbsp;
+3 Hangarback Walker (He is used primarily to get in the way of early aggro with amazing value, and if he survives the early game and gets pumped a few times, our Planar Outburst becomes even better. Also stays on board with an Ugin wrath.) 
&amp;nbsp;
+3 Winds of Qal Sisma (with Embodiments and Jaddis clogging up the board, aggro players will over extend their attacks in hopes of getting through, let them tap out and hit them with a fog, and we'll gain the upper hand.)
&amp;nbsp;
-3 Taigams Scheming (we want creatures in the way to stall out the early aggro game, this spell leaves an open board state, so it's got to go) 
&amp;nbsp;
-4 Hedron Archive (We want to lower our curve a bit, so taking out a set of 4cc makes our early game feel a lot better.) 
&amp;nbsp;
-2 Temporal Trespass (odds are that with the 10 cards we bring in against the aggro match, we'll stall their game plan down enough that we'll hit a Planar Outburst or Ugin in time to gain dominance, so we have more time to find our other extra turn spells) 
&amp;nbsp;
-1 Dig Through Time (Same as Temporal Trespass, we want a low curve to stall out aggro decks, so cutting one more high casting cost spells is favorable for us.) 
&amp;nbsp;
Control:
&amp;nbsp;
+3 Dispel (Control players will, in an attempt to create pressure play a threat leaving open enough mana for 1 counter spell/1 remove spell. Play into this preparing to gain board advantage by Dispelling their 'answer' to our threats. 
&amp;nbsp;
+2 Negate (A small hiccup in an opposing ramp plan or ridding ourselves of a threatening PlanesWalker will put us ahead enough for our opponent to have to chase us because game 2 or 3 they should know what we're doing so we can play around the fact that they know. 
&amp;nbsp;
-3 Planar Outburst (We still have 1 wrath and Ugin, and more often than not a control deck can not recover in time after a single board wipe, so these aren't necessary) 
&amp;nbsp;
-2 Nissa's Renewal (Ramp is always great for us, but this is a high casting cost spell that pushing a faster pace when a faster pace isn't absolutely necessary, we can play a slower game against control, because all it takes is a single opening for us to gain control/win.)

"&gt; I'm not exactly sure how might makes right.
Might is the *only* thing that makes right. There is no right and wrong unless you have a way of protecting and enforcing your chosen ethical axioms.
Look at EU for example -- the economic leverage that 27 states have against any single dissenting one is huge, and this forces everyone to play by the rules even in cases where it might hurt their national interest or specific industries. Without a common currency and market, there would be no barrier to states treating EU laws as more of a ""guideline"" and implementing them selectively, whenever they feel like it.
Might is the only thing that can force countries to forgo pursuit of their own interests at the expense of others. Not even the most enlightened European states are going to do this out of the goodness of their hearts and an inherent sense of fairness -- they will only ever do it when the cost of dissent is too great to pay. 
This is why international law, as it stands, is bollocks. There is no law without a court, and there is no court without binding, enforceable decisions, and there's only one way to enforce things. ",0

"Eh, Blair became pretty corrupted and the whole war thing (which Rowling has made clear she did not support) has overshadowed the very good and leftwing things new labour did, of which Gordon Brown was the architect behind. I actually think Gordon Brown was treated worse in the press than Corbyn, to be honest, and if people had given him a fair chance, we'd be in a better position than we are now. To accuse someone of being a Blairite is frustrating, because what you're accusing them of is supporting an illegal war. Clearly that is not the case with Rowling, or other more centrist politicians now. I don't think we should allow the shadow of Tony Blair stop real progress in the Labour party. The increasing move to the left of Labour is full of popular ideas, many of which I actually love the idea of, but the reality is it alienates a huge portion of voters and just isn't going to work. I feel if you want to stick to those principles no matter what, you should probably support the Green party. Personally, I love the Green party and lots of left wing ideas, but I want the government to actually be able to help people or at the very least provide powerful opposition to the Tories, so I vote Labour. I might not if Jeremy Corbyn is still leader at the next election. As I said, this is my own personal perspective, and I don't really want to get into a political debate, but I think it's probably similar to how Rowling feels.",0

"Mods are not the accuracy police (or the morality police). We are not the free speech police.
The policy of the mod team is generally ""let the users sort it out"", unless it is breaking laws or breaking reddit rules. This doesn't do either.

If I deleted everything that someone said was a lie this place would be fairly sparse (especially in political discussions), and I don't have the time or inclination to be verifying every single post. You might claim this is an obvious, special circumstance where mods should step in, but where is that line? Who decides what gets removed for being a lie and what doesn't? I sure aint verifying every statement made here that's for sure.
Users need to call people on it and vote accordingly. As /u/karatepsychic said

&gt; In Yeltsin’s own autobiography, he wrote about the experience at Randall’s, which shattered his view of communism, according to pundits. Two years later, he left the Communist Party and began making reforms to turn the economic tide in Russia. 
&gt; “When I saw those shelves crammed with hundreds, thousands of cans, cartons and goods of every possible sort, for the first time I felt quite frankly sick with despair for the Soviet people,” Yeltsin wrote. “That such a potentially super-rich country as ours has been brought to a state of such poverty!

You could easily make one yourself though.  Have a table of Income and a tbale of Expenses.  Leave 3 columns under each table:

1.Description

2.Amount

3.Tag

then fill in the blanks as you go.  for example....

1. Description:    Mother's Day present

2. Amount:     $100.00

3. Tag:    Gift

you can even use [Data Validation](http://www.contextures.com/xlDataVal01.html) to have a dropdown list of tags (so you could categorize your expenses).

Then underneath all of that, put your current bank account balance - (column containing expenses amount) + (column containing Income amount)  and that will leave you with a running total.

"&gt; who decides what content is valuable?
That's a good question. I think for entertainment media value should be mostly based on number of viewers (an easily tracked statistic) and if possible adding a factor for reviews (less easy to quantify so I'm uncertain of this point but I do feel it would be more efficient if it could work)
&gt;  What would incentivize me to spend years producing a really good movie when I could put out shit and still get my share of the revenue?
You couldn't, the amount of money you get would be based on the quality of what you produced. 
I'm not imagining a system where money is pre-allocated. I'm imagining a system where you produce your product, market it etc. And then the revenue is based on how it does. So if you produce a movie and and 200Million people watch it and say its the best movie ever maybe you get $1Billion and if you produce a movie and only 1million people watch it and they say it was alright maybe you get $1million. 
&gt;  How would we grow? In other words, what if all the ""content tax"" revenue was spoken for, but I still had a great idea? Do I just... not create it, or do I do it for free? 
Again the money isn't pre-allocated. At the end of the year (or perhaps month) we look at what has been produced and how much value it has generated and allocate the money to all the producers based on the value. If your idea is good you can create it and people will consume it and it's value will be recognized and you will be compensated based on that.
&gt; Who would extend credit to content producers if they didn't stand to make more money back?

"&gt; A higher interest rate has no effect on the demand for credit. It only reduces the quantity of credit demanded.
Look, we can get all technical and into the weeds, but colloquially saying the demand for credit goes down is the same as saying the quantity demanded shrinks as well. Also, that only holds all else being equal, which in the real world isn't true.
&gt;but the interest rate itself is determined by supply and demand, which the banks have no control over.
On the chalkboard of your econ101 class, they don't. But in the real world they do, partly because they operate as an oligopoly. But also, you're not accounting for various transaction costs and other frictioms that distort the ""natural, free-floating interest rate"" into what it really is, which is the rate set by banks in the real world.
&gt;Inflation was high because the central bank allowed the money supply to grow.
That's not my point. My point was to say that it took them forever to get inflation under control, and so it got away from and it took a massive contractionary monetary policy for a number of years to get there.
In other words, inflation can still be rampant, even with a contractionary monetary policy in place.
&gt;Runaway inflation can only happen if the Bank of Canada lets it.
Agreed.
&gt;The banks have no control over inflation because they have no control over the money supply.
Um, yes they absolutely do. They create credit out of thin air. How do you think the monetary base expands? That is the whole point of fractional reserve banking.
They do not have direct levers of control over inflation. But by the simple increase in lending and deposits, they create credit which causes inflation in the economy.
If someone deposits $10,000 into a bank and the bank has a 10% reserve ratio, the money supply theoretically expands to $100,000. That's $90,000 of money created from thin air (credit).

2) Any imitators would have needed to pull a gigantic fanbase towards their own channels (though this might have actually resulted in multiple competing TPPs [](#pogchamp))

However, the result is... shabby, at best. Don't take me wrong: I currently have about 20 hours into it, and i'm liking it. But it is a waste of potential. A very big one, too. There is so many ways to make this game better.

- A more articolate system for factions (why are they all seemingly friendly? Didn't the Vi'keen take over the galaxy at one point?)

- Better space stations (as is, they have about six rooms that are almost the same in every single one, and even the shapes do not seem to vary much)

- Better flying controls (dear lord, why can't I just fly near the ground?)

- A deeper trade system

- More diverse spaceships

- More complex combat/sentinels

- More diverse body types for both sentient and wild life

- More ways to acquire tech (trading?)

- An overhaul of ground textures

And those are the ones i tought of in around five minutes. Thankfully, PC has mods and it seems like Hello Games is going to upgrade the game regularly. In fact, I still believe this could turn out to be a great game. What *reall* pisses me off, however, is this:

Somewhere, in Hello Games' vault is the build of the game that was shown in the trailers. The build with hi-res textures for the ground, the build where sand/ringed planets exist, where the game lets you fly near the ground, where creatures interact with the landscape, where the factions are actual factions and not meters of appreciation.

"Whoo, I got way more invested in this than I thought. Well, here is my response, hope you enjoy the read :)
MCU? Because otherwise S-Class is getting overcrowded (goddamn it I wanna see Iron Fist X Metal Bat).
For MCU, my estimations are:
**S-Class**
*  **Hulk -** since MCU Hulk is ""always angry"", he could provide enough consistent feats to replace Bang at **Rank 3**
* **Ironman -** The only person shown so far to be able to defeat Hulk, with enough firepower to rival Genos, but also the brains to rival Child Emperor and enough funds to outmatch Bofoy, Ironman would either replace Tatsumaki at **Rank 2**, or lower Hulk's rank to 4 and take his **third place**.
* **Vision** - His powerlevel isn't yet set in stone, but I'd speculate he's a bit stronger than Thor. **Rank 4-7 (one above Thor)**
* **Thor -** going toe-to-toe with base Hulk is enough of an accomplishment, but he didn't one-shot those large flying saucers in the first Avengers movie (or not without a power-up either way), so I'd say he ranks somewhere **between 4 and 7**, just because he would be all about protecting the Earth and saving kittens from trees.
**A-Class**
* **Antman** - Because Sweet Mask is camping Rank 1, Antman would be stuck in A-Class **Rank 2**, although his power could yield him a position below Genos. He would also really get on Sweet Mask's nerves and rival him in popularity for his witty one-liners.
* **Scarlet Witch** - We know jack shit about her MCU powers, but it's probably save to assume she's above Fubuki's level. Unsure about the ranking, A-Class has 38 heroes, so maybe around the middle? **Rank 19**?
* **War Machine -** I'd say when it comes to defeating monsters he's about the equivalent of Spring Mustachio, that is, depends if the plot needs to progress. **Rank 28**
* **Captain America** - Definitively the weakest of the A-Class Avengers, but still stronger than Sneck, so I'd place him at **Rank 36**
**B-Class**
* **Falcon -** He would probably join the Blizzard group, along with Cap untill Cap is promoted to A-Class, but Falcon probably isn't strong enough to make it past Fubuki, unless she lets him. **Rank 2**
* **Black Widow -** She could probably take on Tank Top Black Hole, ofc not barefisted, but she doesn't fight like that, I just think she wouldn't be that interested in doing Hero Work on her own, so I'd place her at **Rank 82**
**C-Class**
* **Hawkey** - **Rank 2**. He's good with a bow, but his poor heart couldn't bear toppling over Licenless Rider and he's not good enough for B-Class
**Honorable Mentions**
* **Quicksilver** - He would make it into A-Class on his own, and if Bang/Atomic Samurai/Lightspeed Flashy Flash trained him, then into S-Class as well
* **Winter Soldier** - This is a tough one. He's as strong/stronger than Cap, but is he interested in being a Hero? I guess Civil War will answer that, but for now I'd say he's a Tiger level threat, with some Hydra funds maybe Demon level.
* **Nick Fury** - He'd work for the Hero Association, for sure, as well as that girl that everybody except me remember the name of, you know, the one who played Robin in HIMYM, she could potentially even become a C-Class hero of her own.

"&gt; and women, specifically, are made sure to also be put into combat roles. Women in the military, but not in combat roles, doesn't do anyone any favors... well, except the women of course. 

I don't think women who aren't physically strong enough should be put in combat roles. This would be ""equality for the sake of equality"", it would do more harm than good. For one, it would create weak links in the military, and for second, these women wouldn't be respected by the male soldiers *not* because they're women, but because they suck at their job, and this might create resentment or more negative views against women in general. And I would say the same for men too - not every man is fit to serve in a combat role. There are many roles in the military that don't require a lot of physical strength yet are just as useful and needed. Combat roles should be left for men *and* women who can actually handle them and wouldn't become a burden or dead weight to their colleagues, not just ""nooo, let's put all women in combat roles because muh equality!"". And I'm saying this as a woman. I'm 5'6, 125lbs, so not exactly petite and I'm fairly sure I could train myself to become strong enough to serve in combat and I'd be willing to do that for the sake of equality, but I can't imagine some of my 5'3, 95lbs friends doing the same.

All-female unit would be another thing, though, it would certainly help if all the female soldiers there would feel equal amongst others and had similar abilities so they might face less discrimination or disrespect from others.

&gt; I mean, send an all-female group into a certain-death situation, and you're a misogynist

I've never heard anyone being accused of being a misogynist for asking women do the job they're there to do.

&gt; Of course, I doubt that any of these situations are really going to happen. We have expectations, not to mention biological conditioning, for men to be protectors, and the military, particularly combat positions, is really the only place men can enact such a life and death struggle.

There are countries that have mandatory draft for both men and women, like Israel or North Korea (when you think of it it's interesting and sort of ironic that countries that are far from the perceived gender equality in the West are much more gender-equal in some other aspects. Some European countries that are considered more traditonal also have significantly higher numbers of female soldiers than Western Europe or North America). Some countries also have all-female units that actually do dangerous shit and aren't only there for decoration. I don't see why it would be so impossible.",0

http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/33vax8/whats_the_best_engine_free_to_make_2d_pixel_games/

4 days ago you started looking at Game Maker (and asked someone what 'code' to learn to use it, so I'm assuming you didn't do much with it). Already decided thats not good enough.

Asking about UE4 here, but never heard of blueprints (did you even look at their own website?)

In both your posts you reference Greenlight, App store, releasing on Steam etc etc 

You're 14 but state you have ""a lot of pixel art, and graphic design history"".


Sorry. Get the idea of releasing anything out of your head. I'm calling it now, it aint gonna happen.

Dial everything way way way down.

Pick an engine, any engine, it really doesn't matter. Don't pick a game yet. Don't plan some bit title. It aint gonna happen and will only kill any motivation you have.

Pick an engine, then pick some tutorials. All of them have plenty of stuff out there. Google to find it. Learn to Google. Don't think i'm taking the piss here, as an experienced developer with 10 years or so industry experience, learning to *really* Google your problems is the number 1 skill any developer needs.

Do a tutorial. Then expand it, adapt it.

Make SMALL things. Even just little visual demos. Want to make a platformer? Just get a cube bouncing around an envrionment. Once thats done...move on. Try something visual. Experiment with shaders. Anything.

That plan you have for some big 2D platformer. Sideline it. Return to it literally in a year or so if you go at it full.

Dismissing GameMaker in only 4 days without even knowing what ""code"" to learn, because you ""dont really think thats for making games that will eventually be sold in the app or android store, or even Steam"" shows you're aiming way too high. With your level of experience the quality of the engine for releasing something should be much lower down on your list of requirements.


**Edit - Also in your last post you mention wanting to get an engine for free or...""(or one that I can get from the bay..)""**

**So you want to make money from the game you release but pirate the software to do it. Not only is that spectacularly stupid but you can fuck right off with that attitude.**

"""Valuable"" is such a stupid term to determine player value since it's so context-dependent. If a reliever throws 80 shutout innings with a 17.0 K/9 but only does it in games where his team is up by 6 or more, was he valuable?
Betances and Davis were two of the five best relievers in the league last year (Chapman, Kimbrel, Doolittle). Davis had the higher K/9, lower ERA, and far more holds; Betances pitched more innings, had better WHIP, prettier SIERA and FIP for the sabermetric crowd, and, contextually, had more WPA, meaning he pitched in more high-leverage situations. On the whole I give the nod to Dellin, but it's obscenely close. They're both obviously ridiculously good, so the debate is academic anyway.",0

"These threads always get me emotional; it's a good thing my dad is used to my random teary 'love you' calls by now. 
I came out to my parents around the same age your daughter did, and I also had two parents react very differently. My father reacted like he had been planning that moment his whole life (and he still maintains that he knew before I did.) My mother, on the other hand, comes from a very Catholic Mexican family, and she reacted . . . less well. 
In my case, a lot of that was due to shock. My mother recovered and made it up. She apologized for her initial reaction soon afterwards and explained why that was her knee-jerk reaction. She's changed *a lot* since then, and her beliefs towards homosexuality are as liberal as my own. She also grew really close to my girlfriend, and it's hard to imagine her having that same reaction now. 
It's heartbreaking that your wife hasn't come around, but even if she had, I suspect your daughter will always be grateful for your own support. I'll never forget my father's reaction, and how it suddenly made me realize that everything was going to be okay. I'm tearing up a little bit writing this, but I'm indescribably lucky for that. Knowing that he had my back at that moment was enough. ",0

"&gt; Spawn, kill, die, repeat is all this game is ever going to be at the heart of it. It's all any shooter game ever is. If people are looking for something beyond that simple cycle then this probably isn't their game. Multilayer shooters in general probably aren't their thing.

"I started in CIS years ago in a different school and am now finishing up MIS. When I restarted school, I went with MIS after working for a large IT services company. While they both are in the same field, they are very different and you have to decide what you like more.
Computer Science is a very coding heavy degree. They get a very thorough knowledge in one field. It's a more academic degree, and (in my opinion) more valuable when you follow it up with a graduate degree. 
MIS has coding (obviously) but is supplemented with general knowledge, management and business skills. It is less academic, more rounded, and in my work experience (with my 100k+ employee employer), more valuable.  They work with a customer to design and maintain systems, and bring a team together to build or replace them.
With CIS, you hear the stereotypes. Of course positions vary, but 60+ hour weeks working with fellow coders taking breaks only to eat and use the bathroom are common. Not every position, but chances are you will run into something similar in your career. When you specialize in a hot field, the potential pay is amazing.
MIS is more customer facing. While you can work like above,  in many positions, they are the primary contact with the customer. They build relations, plan, decide, handle budgets, etc. They determine the requirements and build the team - they bring in the CS majors.

On the iphone to other devices it depends on what you want do you want a good set of speakers, camera, a good network connection, a good screen, good software support, good battery life, ULTRA CHEAP, lots of roms (most of the time its about how common the phone is and how hard is it locked down only look for ARM cpus in your phone if you want them also other ones are a pain), a aftermarket UI or googles basic one, or powerful hardware.  there are LOTS of choices also be warned if your going to be using a custom rom go out and buy your phone outright from the manufacture unlocked its just easier that way since AT&amp;T likes locking things and version dose the same so buying a phone from Tmobile also be be a rats nest because they resell the traded in phones some of them will still have locked bootloaders so no custom roms.

What is *not* ableism is enjoying the benefits and abilities of one's own body (playing basketball, climbing a flight of stairs) or refusing to hire/have someone who has a condition that makes them completely unsuitable for a job or task (someone who falls asleep suddenly and would not be a good truck driver, nor would someone blind make a good surgeon).

"About a couple years ago me and friend went to Bosnia in order to go sightseeing, go to some schools (she's a teacher).
A week passed and we were at the airport as we wanted to return home and there we saw that our flight was delayed or in other words it was cancelled. We couldn't go anywhere as we didn't had much money left.
As the airport had to close we were told to leave and had to stay somewhere. There was this youngish Muslim guy who came up to us and asked us to stay with him and his family as he himself had little money available at that moment.
On the way to his home he spoke to (I think) his wife that he had guests and if she could prepare something for us.
When we arrived in his house(it was in a rural area of the country) we saw that his wife had prepared some food and set two beds on the side ready for us. He told us that he was going to stay in the other room with his family and that we could stay in this room. So I said ok!
When we woke up  (bit earlier than them) I saw that this was the only room in this house... There was no other room... All other doors were for something else like toilet or storage. We saw that he and his family slept in the barn, just so we could stay in the house.
I was ashamed sleeping in the only roon they had. And he told us that it was a good deed and that the Bosnian people appreciate us coming to their country.",0

"&gt;[Intersex variations occur (though rarely) in species which use sexual reproduction. Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that lie between those of typical males and typical females. Older terms include the word hermaphrodite, but this term is now only used for animals which have both natural male and female organs. The clinical term 'disorders of sex development' (DSDs) is very controversial.
An individual's genitalia may be atypical in some way. It can be difficult to determine if an intersex baby is genetically male or female (with XY chromosomes or XX chromosomes). They may also have male and/or female secondary sex characteristics (such as body shape). However, there is a wide range of variation in sexual anatomy. There are many more subtle forms of sex anatomy, or sex chromosome differences. These don't even show physically. Some won't show up until later in life. Sometimes, the variation may appear when the baby reaches puberty or becomes an adult.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersexuality)",0

I don't get it. I haven't liked anything he did except for Unforgiven. Sure American Sniper came out looking more important than a lot of what he's done lately but I disliked it too. Whereas some people saw a challenging masterpiece about wartime morality what I saw was the essence of Hollywood mediocrity on the subject. It certainly played that way at Oscars, as some thing that existed to reinforce phony beliefs about what the Iraq war was all about, heroism and what it's like to be a soldier.",0

Kids are in school about 36 weeks a year, which means feeding them lunch costs around $540 per year. That's not a whole lot, I'd just make my own coffee instead of going to dunkin donuts every morning and break even. Hell, I just saved more than that by actually shopping around for car insurance. My kid would also then be eating a much better lunch than what the school provides. At $20k/yr, free school lunch for your kids is a lifesaver. Once you hit $40k its still tough, but it starts becoming a matter of prioritization over necessity. ",0

"I'm a web developer who has been using Linux for over a decade (I started in 2000), and in that time I've used a lot of distros (Mandrake, Gentoo, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint). There's a lot of ""Ubuntu or Mint"" comments here; my advice, go with Mint.
Ubuntu *used* to be the darling of the Linux community, but the reason many now recommend Mint is that Ubuntu's creator, Mark Shuttleworth, has taken a very Steve Jobsian approach to managing the distro.  Which is to say, it's his way or the highway, and the community be damned.  Unity was a perfect example of this: Ubuntu embraced Unity and made it the standard windows manager long before it was ready, and as a result a lot of Ubuntu users got burned when they tried to use their favorite distribution, couldn't, and discovered that they weren't relevant to Shuttleworth.
If you're fine with putting your faith in Shuttleworth there's nothing wrong with Ubuntu: it's still a solid distro.  But the thing is, the Linux community is all about putting faith in ""the people"", not ""one person"".  The Linux Mint team embraces the community, as evidenced by them offering several different versions of Mint rather than forcing a particular windows manager on you.  If you go with Mint, you know that future versions are going to have the new things people have asked for ... not the new things the big guy at the top has decided they should have.",0

christ, it's obvious his wife is an asshole, but assholes traditionally respond poorly to being treated like assholes. no matter how selfish her reasons for welching are, if he doesn't treat her with empathy, there's a 0% chance she'll see what harm she's doing because she'll be stuck in the same mindset that led to this shitshow in the first place. if the endgame is OP's health and pursuit of his dreams, how the hell is ""come to an accord that avoids the nuclear option of divorce and gets the agreement back on track"" not option #1?
i realize i may seem like I'm being soft on his wife, but the opposite is true. she holds the cards here because she's an asshole and is willing to put herself first where OP did not. divorce would be a hundred times easier on her than it would be on him, and would absolve her of any of the responsibility that she agreed to 8 years ago. it's time for her to nut up, but there's a fucking method to rein in narcissists--empathy and therapy, which begins with counseling.

I see many people with the same mindset as you. They mistaken me as the same as a Cambodian or Viet but our cultures are pretty different. But thats besides the point. 
I know plenty of Vietnamese people opening nail salons, Cambodians opening used car dealership but I also see many of them working in factories bringing their family members in or in college getting degrees. Many of my close friends parents came to America because they were forced out of their homes due to the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnam War.  Heck, my father came with the clothes on his back and roughly 18 dollars, and believe me- he didn't have any options. He had to work 3 jobs just to find a way for 3 children. And on the subject of scamming, he got scammed in America by doing one of those Work-At-Home things where he did plenty of work and got no pay from it. Needless to say, that made him a bit bitter. 
I feel as if there's a common thinking in our combined culture where we feel as if we have to catch up with the rest of the world. A common thinking where we feel cheated, and can't have the luxury other people have just because ""we aren't the same as them"". I've heard the saying many times ""$100 for them dinner for one night,  $100 for us food for whole week"". 
People assume these scammers are going into regular homes with TV's and working bathrooms, but they're going into poor households with big families.

"No he is more or less right. An audio interface is basically an array of inputs, an analogue to digital converter, a digital to analogue converter, a clock generator and an array of outputs. 
I have an RME Fireface UFX. I use 8x analogue TRS line inputs for recording audio from 4x hardware synthesizers. I use between 1x and 4x preamped mic/instrument inputs for mic recording and guitar. It varies depending on the guitar. One of my guitars has a soundboard transducer and a magnetic pickup so that uses 2x instrument inputs by itself and sometimes I mic the fretboard too.
I use 2x analogue XLR outputs to go into monitor speakers and anywhere from 2x to 4x analogue TRS outputs for external routing to pedals, effects units and stuff like that.
The UFX has MIDI i/o but I don't use it. I use 4x physical MIDI in and 4x physical MIDI out going through an ESI M8UXL MIDI interface. Then between the physical i/o and FL Studio there is the virtual port routing in MIDI OX which is mainly for working around crappy/buggy MIDI.
Both the UFX and M8U are connected to my PC via USB 2.0. I'm using RME's proprietary ASIO driver which is really nice.
The bus interface doesn't really matter. I can use USB 2.0 or Firewire 400 but it makes no difference.
Most motherboards these days have integrated audio interfaces. They are perfectly fine as long as you don't need a multiclient ASIO driver and you don't need to plug lots of audio devices in like guitars, microphones, synthesizers. Otherwise you need more inputs and outputs.
You can do MIDI over USB but it gets more complicated if you have lots of DIN MIDI gear and I don't know how that will work. Also I don't know how you handle virtual MIDI over USB but you may not need it. I'm sure theres a way to improvise around it.
I used onboard for about 2 years and I thought it was fine for bedroom production. There are some things you can't do with ASIO4ALL. I can't have multiple programs open processing audio because ASIO4ALL isn't multi client and it seems to want exclusive access. I dunno. I have to close down FL Studio if I want to play a reference track in Windows Media Player. Thats annoying.",0

It would also help if you talk with your nanny about if she could distract him in a way (playing with toys/a fun game/etc.) and you guys slip out after saying goodbye. Also talking with him about the nanny and her role can help a ton. He's 3 so he should have a good concept on the roles of people around him. You could also as a major help, constantly reassure him that mommy and daddy will always come back (i.e., ""Mommy always comes back"" or ""Daddy always comes back""). Those 2 phrases help a ton with my other 2yo charge who dealt with a lot of separation anxiety and also associated me coming to mom leaving in the beginning.

"The beginning is a great place to start.
The first couple of UFC's were basically infomercials for Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.  But they are interesting.  The BJJ guys were absolutely dominant back then and if anyone had told me that today there wouldn't be a Gracie as a world champion in top level MMA I would have laughed in your face!
The evolution of the idea up to today is pretty interesting as well.  You had the fall of BJJ to Elite level wrestlers who figured out that learning enough BJJ not to get submitted wasn't that hard for them.
You had the matches of Tank Abbot which are responsible for most of the rules against really dirty fighting in the UFC today.
Then the torch passing to the elite level strikers once they figured out that they could learn to defend against the takedowns of even most of the top level wrestlers and that as long as you weren't getting taken down you didn't need to learn a whole lot of BJJ.
Today there is a fundamental skill set that top level MMA fighters have that includes elements of wrestling, ground combat and striking.  There's still specialization of course but not to the degree it was in UFC 1 where part of the interest of the fights was to see whose martial art was the most effective.",0

Whatever ethereal grievance you have with the idea of a state, it can't be more important than the actual well-being of the citizenry.
I even think your hostility to the idea of a state is misguided. States are just the expression of a populations desire to unite towards common goals according to their own values. Most critical, the state allows us to police ourselves and to provide for a collective self-defense. Nobody is arguing for a government that interferes with your basic economic activity. In fact, it is through the institution of the state that this is defended. The state enforces laws to protect your rights. There are many examples of ineffective governments, but surely a constitutional democracy alleviates most of those concerns.",0

I know police culture and the thin blue line and it's hard to turn in someone for misconduct, but serous, with every bad news we hear, there is almost always one or two or more other cops on the scene, but no one saw anything or comes forward on their own. These aren't good cops. I don't care what they do 99% of their shift, you can't back up and stay silent over the shitty attitude and practices by a colleague. I have plenty of friends who are cops and the amount of stories they told me where they took the law into their own hand, or laughed when another cop did it is ridiculous.

"Flirting really isn't that complicated. I am a pretty damn direct person. I am not one of these timid nice guys myself. Even though i haven't had any success with women, I have made moves on many of them and observed others going through that process as well. If a girl is in to a guy, or at least receptive, she makes it obvious, and, most of the time, it will be hard for him to mess it up if he at least has to courage to try. On the other hand, if a girl is not into you, she will make that clear as well. However, most of the guys on this sub have only ever seen the negative reaction, so they mistakenly come to the conclusion that girls must be very subtle and complex when it comes to flirting, though the truth is that just haven't ever had a girl want to flirt back. It would take a really talented individual to win a girl over on charm alone when she already has prejudged that he isn't worth her time. You would be better off finding ways to compensate for your deficits than trying to master the art of flirting. If you can make yourself attractive enough or successful enough, then you will find flirting all of a sudden becomes very easy.  ",0

They could look for a nice one together and if he did not like it maybe compromise on just cut it short so it is easier to maintain but maybe save the colour so he can get used to one thing at a time as an example. If he were involved more he would probably be more positive towards it and have an easier time with how it looks.

So once it's used once you can start building up to 10%, twice up to 20%, three times up to 30%, and so on, potentially having 50% ult charged already when the teleporter is destroyed.
That would probably be a bit *too* fast, though, so maybe Symmetra can't retain the ult charge through death if the teleporter is up. That would mean she could get a new teleporter twice as fast, but she would have to stay alive consistently.",0

"According to the Wiktionary, Fascism is
""A political regime, having totalitarian aspirations, ideologically based on a relationship between business and the centralized government, business-and-government control of the marketplace, repression of criticism or opposition, a leader cult and exalting the state and/or religion above individual rights. Originally only applied (usually capitalized) to Benito Mussolini's Italy.""
So, to be fascist, a nation must:
1. Place the good of the nation above the good of it's people.
2. Engage in total government control to that end.
If a nation respects rights and tries to improve things for people without ignoring these rights, even if they're a totalitarian state with complete economic control, they're not fascist. Hence, although China strictly regulates business and manages economic growth through 5 year plans, as these plans include benefits for the common man they are not fascist.
Similarly, if a nation is super patriotic and calls upon it's citizens to lay down their lives in defense of liberty, it may be placing the needs of the nation above the needs of the common man, but so long as it does not take the power needed to coerce that cooperation and allows people to freely choose, it's also not a fascist state.",0

"&gt; I had NO IDEA this was set in Denver until one of the characters said so. 
I was waiting to see if anyone else would comment before I answered you, I didn't want to say too much. About this^ It doesn't matter to me if anyone knows what city we're in. It only gets mentioned because it has a story purpose.
&gt;I'm not sure who I'm really supposed to focus on.
and
&gt;got tired in a hurry of all the vocabulary....... I'm supposed to keep straight The Shaphet, zedak, rapaxian, rahkrosa 
So, I wanted to discuss this.  Why would you think you have to keep them straight? That's my job as a writer, to use them in context so when you encounter them again, you recognize them.  See, you really don't have to recall the name of the dagger strapped inside Marijus' forearm. But it needs a name, because a ceremonial blade has one. 
You don't have to remember everyone's name. In fact, people rarely recall characters names in movies and TV shows, except possibly one or two.  But they recall characters.  Everybody remembers ""Terminator"" because that's what he was. This is a problem I've found with reading a screenplay meant to be viewed. 
There's some kids and their moms. If you need to recall that later on, you will. Because the writer will make sure you can. 
At any rate, I reworked Act 1 to make it flow more easily based on your comments.  I didn't change the flashbacks, but I did integrate them more. I don't think of them as flashbacks, I think of them as visual aids.  I moved some things around so on page 22 Marijus says:
&gt;For months now, this Abaddon has killed at will without the police ever realizing there's a serial killer at work. .... He's perfecting what he'll teach the children to do when he takes over. ... The plan is to find him before he can get here. So he never will.
Which is also the end of Act 1 and will hopefully make the  story and stakes clear. ",0

2017-03-27 08:25Xinhua Editor: Gu Liping
China had 131 billion dollars worth of private start-ups by the end of 2016, nearly doubling the figure of the year before, said an official with Ministry of Science and Technology.
Zhang Zhihong, director of the ministry's Torch High Technology Industry Development Center, made the remarks while opening an institute for small and medium enterprise research in Tianjin over the weekend.
He used the term ""unicorn,"" rarely used by Chinese officials, which refers young, unlisted companies with a market value of over 1 billion U.S. dollars, based on private funding sources.
China's unicorns are spread over 16 cities, but mostly in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. The majority are innovation-driven tech businesses, Zhang said.
A report published by the torch center earlier this year said half of China's unicorns are in Beijing's Zhongguancun, home to China's three super-unicorns worth over 10 billion U.S. dollars: Xiaomi, Didi Chuxing, and Meituan.
One third of Zhongguancun's unicorns were born after 2014. They focus on four domains -- e-commerce, culture and entertainment, Internet finance, and transportation, according to the report ""Development of China's Unicorn Enterprises in 2016"".
In fact, Zhongguancun is second only to Silicon Valley as the most concentrated area for tech unicorns in the world, the report says.
Zhang said a pro-innovation business environment, conductive policies, and good services are key to the growth of unicorns.
""Unicorns have become important engine to maintaining medium-high growth and to transforming industry,"" Zhang said. ""Their emergence is key to development of the sharing, smart, and platform economies.""

"&gt; All the conflicts you're describing stopped long ago until the west occupied Iraq thereby spelling chaos.
Stopped long ago, before the occupation? Okay, what about the 1975-1990 Lebanese civil war, fought along sectarian lines? Or the Muslim Brotherhood's terror campaign from 92-2000? The 1979 Grand Mosque Seizure in Saudi Arabia? the 1999 Iraqi Shia Uprising? The 1987 Mecca Massacre? 
Don't pretend that things were hunky-dory, that entire region has been a hotbed for religious infighting since the Crusades. The only reason things seemed slightly more calm in decades past than now is because a few groups had finally established a semblance of border authority due to Britain's enforcement. Except for, you know, the constant fighting between Israel and all of it's neighbors. 
&gt; at least the conflicts would be constrained to the middle east and no one would have a motive for attacking France if it wasn't for France's own foreign policy.
 
Lets not forget the 1992 attack of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires(Buenos Aries of all places!). Or the one that happened in London in 1994. How about Air France 8969 hijacking by Algerian Islamists of the same year? Or the 1997 bus bombings in *Xianjing China*.
These assholes are spilling into the rest of the world, not due to our actions, but due to their own twisted ideaology.

"&gt;However, the researchers found that air quality improved as they moved away from the smoker. ""These results show what common sense would suggest—when you're within a few feet downwind of a smoker, you get exposed,"" Ott explained. ""But likewise, when you go a little distance or stay upwind, the exposure goes way down. *If there's just one smoker, and you can sit six feet away, you would have little problem. At the same time, if there are a lot of smokers nearby, you may be exposed to very high levels of secondhand smoke. So this thing that critics have been dismissing as trivial is not.""*

"I sometimes wonder how much Ross and Rachel affected our opinions on ""taking a break."" 
Well, if anybody said a specific person was off-limits, that person was off-limits. We also had a don't-ask-don't-tell rule. I don't know if he did anything with anybody, he doesn't know if I did anything with anybody. (I am curious, though, but I think it's just me.) We saw each other summer 2014 for a few weeks, and then I moved to another country. It was unsaid, but I assumed we were closed after seeing each other again. So I then asked if we could open it up again, based partially on depression but also lust for some uni friends. (Yeah.) We're now closed, after the engagement.
It ended up working well for us, I think. I don't feel it's caused damage. Of course, this is from my perspective, as the person who asked for the opening. His perspective might be different or not as happy. I do still sometimes feel guilt for asking for it to be opened, multiple times.
I have had friends tell me that opening a relationship just seems like having permission to cheat.  They weren't passing judgment on me, but they knew it wouldn't be their cup of tea. It's really up to each couple and person to decide where their limitations are and where the black and white lines are, and where the grey exists. ",0

"No kidding currently that would be skittish, which really just screws tanks.
I would rather see something like:
* Shifty: Trash takes reduced damage from AoE
* Taunting: One mob in each pack buffs nearby allies reducing the damage they take by 90%. So you need to FF that one target.
* Enrage: When an enemy dies it causes another enemy to go into a rage (and ideally shout something like ""You killed my brother!!"") growing in size over 3 seconds. Once it is fully grown it focuses a random party member and moves increasingly faster towards that target. If the enemy reaches the target party member they die.
* Shattering: Only applies to bosses. Bosses will throw up an elemental shield that will shatter dealing 100% of the damage absorbed by the shield divided evenly over the entire party. (Party deals 15 million, better hope everyone has 3 million health, or defensive cooldowns).
* Feedback: Killing an enemy causes you to deal 50% less damage until combat drops (forces you to balance damage dealt to targets).
* Lock out: Abilities enemies use periodically. If an enemy is attacked with a single target ability while lock out active, that ability is locked out for 30 seconds. Pay attention on bosses, cycle in AoE abilities.
There are a TON of ideas regarding affixes that forces DPS to actually think and do something different.  Currently affixes don't really mean anything to DPS, they are all either the tank needs to do something or the healer needs to save people.
There are 2 ways you can have affixes impact DPS:
* Hurt their damage in some way so they need to adapt (see taunting,or lock out) requiring players to respect and use alternatives for short periods of time.
* Have ignoring the mechanics be punished directly and undeniable. Whether that is death (shattering or enrage) or an individual punishment (lock out or dealing crap damage for trying to AoE targets that take no damage).",0
"You're pretty much guaranteed to see a few non-venomous snakes along the way.  Venomous snakes are more rare but they do live along the trail so encountering one is a possibility.  Be careful in rocky, ledgy terrain on warm sunny days.  Always look first before you scramble over a fallen log or a large rock.  
Generally, if you don't bother them, they won't bother you.  Typically, you pretty much have to be going out of your way to harass a snake before it will bite (most victims of snake bites are young males; there is a very good reason for this).  The AT is a well traveled corridor, and most wildlife living along it is adapted to that fact.  Stories of them getting into your sleeping bag while you're asleep are exaggerated- that is extremely unlikely on the east coast.  ",0

therefore if you define being trans as ""identifying as different gender than the one assigned at bird"" there are no trans people without dysphoria, according to the dsm, because by that very wide definition of being trans, they all have dysphoria.

Phenom II x4 920
Radeon HD 5770 1gb

Backstory: I had built a machine in December 2008. It was a Phenom x4 9650, Radeon HD 4770. My PSU failed in January 2011, ruining most of my internal parts. Unfortunately, I didn't know what all had been fried by the PSU failure, so I had to replace parts one at a time, maintaining compatibility with the existing parts. By the time I got the machine working again, the only thing that I still had from the original was the ram, case, optical drive and hard drives. (PSU failure fried the gpu, cpu, and mobo) If I had known from the start that I'd be basically getting a whole new PC, I'd have opted for better parts instead of trying to keep things compatible with my existing hardware. I've wanted to upgrade for a while, but as of right now this pc is still powerful enough and Zen isn't too far away.",0

"Act in haste, repent at leisure. Who knows what might happen in those 2 weeks waiting to make the announcement? MVG might do something that massively flips community opinions and changes hearts.
Someone could have bought a ticket the day before, or the day before the day before this announcement, during the whole fracas. Taking your time to make a decision, chatting with MVG, making the message tailored for all parties to be happy, etc.
People can still cancel things 3 weeks ahead of time. It's not a huge problem, I've cancelled and refunded plane tickets days beforehand before due to needing to change plans. 
It's a pain for some people, but sometimes it happens. I'm not really seeing how you're justifying that as their responsibility. I haven't seen an event attendance schedule for anything with more than 500+ attendees that isn't locked down until the week before the event.
Tying your decision to go to an event to 2 people being there is a little silly. No person's attendance to any event is ever guaranteed, any of them can get sick, lives and situations change, cancellations of people attending happen all the time. It's not really something organisers are ethically bound to in my opinion.

"Islamophobia is the biggest crock of shit i've heard of recently. It is by no means unreasonable to be afraid of a death cult (of Islamism) that is not only actively followed but exercised to its fullest extremes, quite literally by the book (textbook example being the life of Mohammed as written in the Hadiths). There are those with undue hatred towards Muslims as there always have been, but they are no more numerous than they ever were. Let's not kid ourselves this hatred that's being spread further than ever before, namely to the everyday person doesn't just spring up out of nowhere. How many Muslims were being hated before 9/11, and the subsequent ramping up of terrorist activity following it? I mean for goodness sake you can mock any other religion be it Buddhism to Mormonism (which is openly mocked and celebrated on a broadway musical despite being so new a religion you can still see the amniotic fluids) but dont you dare go about drawing Mohammed. The common reply to this being that it is entirely the fault of foreign policy and colonialism by the hands of the west, namely the US; but among the dozens of countries victim to this same colonization and gun boat diplomacy why is it only the few linked to Islam as a political force have all succumbed to these extremist shit holes, which are hotbeds for terrorist activity?  
The problem with Islam the religion is that it seeks not only to be a value system by which individuals can choose to live by but a system by which to rule over a people. Thus it aggregates political power in an attempt to seize control. This engine by which it does so always falls into the hands of those that would mould it, much like any other political system, to a cudgel to bludgeon the masses into submission. The unique problem with this is that opposing it does not mean a simple revolution but an act of blasphemy and sacrilege, for who is a mortal to refute the word of God as decreed to them by Mohammed? And therein lies the problem with Islamic fundamentalist states. Any political action contrary to the system to reform it is treacherous to both nation, state, and God. How does one even begin to move past that?
I'm sure I'll get it in the replies if i'm not downvoted to all hell, but this is not me giving a justification for those that have an irrational fear (phobia) of Islam, and of course there are a small minority of the population who are truly xenophobic to extreme action. All I'm saying is that there are plenty of rational reasons to fear and detest Islamism, the political force that has swept away the secular middle east in the past 80 years. 
E: [heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUGmv5TGaTc) a great debate for those interested. (More nuanced than my statement but of course this could be discussed until Mohammed does resurrect the dead and it still wouldn't be over.)",0

"&gt; I think it's about being loved as a person and not as an actor/provider.
Right. I think the actor/provider is often just a facade. It's a pain in the ass pretending you're someone you're not. Presenting a strong front 24/7. 
It is so much easier without putting in so much effort to be someone better that what you see yourself as, internally.
I've found that this *""I wish people would like me for who I really am""* way of thinking doesn't help. The sentiment is easy to sympathize with, but more often than not it's used by a lot of us to justify being lazy.
We aren't supposed to be static beings. Each of us is dynamic and who we are today might not be who we are tomorrow. 
We don't *have* to enjoy working out every day. It's tough. ""Who I really am today"" might be a lazy fuck who doesn't enjoy difficult tasks and would prefer to just fuck around. But by striving hard to be what we are not today, we might eventually make it a habit to become someone better.

"Wow there's a lot to unpack there. I'll try to get to all of it paragraph by paragraph.
Claiming the alt-right to be 'multi-racial' is absurdity bordering on parody. While there may be some highly confused non-white people involved it's always been and always will be a white supremacy movement. Any amount of observation will confirm this instantly.
Why is it a problem if white people become a minority in a multicultural country? There's nothing that white people can do that nobody else can. It's simply not something that has any effect on a regular person's day to day life. I don't give a fuck what race i'm interacting with, why should you? They're every bit as Canadian as we are. In fact many of them recognised the greatness of this country and worked for years to come here and share in our overabundance. Why would we deny them that? We have more than enough for all of them. Demographic changes really aren't making Toronto or even Canada a worse place to live for most of us.
I say 'most of us' because I need to address your next point. I've lived in Toronto for literally decades being white as hell and I've never felt the slightest amount of tension or even attention drawn to my skin colour. I've hung out in missisauga, in scarborough, up in north york, and never heard the slightest whisper of anti-whiteness. I'm frankly incredulous at your reports of victimization. I contend that the reason you've been getting bad reactions from non-white people is simply the fact that you're the kind of person who posts on /r/altright unironically. They can tell, you know. And calling someone 'chalk-skin' is so absurd I literally don't believe that happened to you.
&gt;With current immigration and birth rate trends, there will be NO WHERE left for Europeans
This is a mischaracterization. With the current immigration and birth rates, there will be NO WHERE left for Europeans who believe that their melanin levels define them.
I agree, we all deserve a place to call our own. And we all deserve to pick where that is, and if we can get there, more power to us. Limiting that by race is arbitrary and daft.
&gt;so what the hell do I get to call my own, cause apparently Canada is for everyone.
Canada? You're a part of everyone. Are you a toddler throwing a tantrum because he refuses to share? You're terrified of being a minority, but the only possible physical consequence I can think of is better food.
&gt;yes, my ancestors being murderers does actually give me right over this country
That pretty much sums up the validity of all your ideas. But I'm curious about what you mean by the hispanic vote in the US proving something, please elaborate.
And finally, in your last paragraph you contend that if white people were to become a minority, you'd be in favour of ethnic cleansing. I want you to take a second, sit back, and really think about that statement, because that's what's going to happen, by your own admission. Canada is simply not going to have a massive change of heart. This trend will continue, and you're either going to learn to deal with it, or be committed to murdering 16 million civilians. Is that the kind of person you want to be? Rounding up terrified civilians and gunning them down? Because this looks like the future you are expecting, and I'm just very curious about what kind of man can call himself a proud Canadian while advocating for the massacre of half the country.",0

"&gt; It's government that has an actual direct political effect.
Why is 'political' effect the criteria? The health and well being of my colleagues, my family, and my friends has a FAR greater effect on my day to day life. Why is 'national government' the criteria for determining the in-group that matters to me.
&gt; Well the people in Kansas are closer so their job loss will have a much greater affect than an equivalent action in Vietnam. 
Maybe maybe not. But it definitely doesn't have a greater effect than job losses in my city, or job losses for ME. If a policy helped me but hurt people in Kansas, the question still stands, why should I give a shit about them?

Why should I care about people because they live in a certain legal jurisdiction as me?

Why would I not want to advocate for the expansion of sovereignty to a wider jurisdiction (like by negotiating international trade agreements)?

"Oh

This is literally where I lived. That mosque is about 10 minutes walk from my parent's house. I actually have family members involved in helping running this mosque. Here are some details for you.

First things first. Christian Estrosi, former mayor of Nice (currently holds a position described as ""vice-mayor"" while no one knows who the actual mayor is because Estrosi still acts as such), and also president of he Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur - PACA - region (basically South East of France) is an incredible, total anti-Muslim bigot. Estrosi has deployed countless efforts to literally counter any Muslim initiative to do anything in Nice. We ran into endless trouble to book a big room for Eid prayers because he personally always veto'd it (we used to pray outside in an empty industrial area before...). He also decided this mosque will be his number 1 fight because he refuses to acknowledge it (please note, he's not the mayor and technically has no authority to do so). At the same time, while blocking Muslim initiatives in Nice, and refusing any kind of funding, mister Estrosi travels to Israel to show his support to Netanyahu after UN condemned Israel for their colonizing actions. He also promised that the PACA region would give 50,000 euros - that's basically from our tax - to support the KKL (Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael), an Israeli group supporting expansion to the colonies deemed illegal. Anyway. You get who the guy is now. Estrosi claims secularism is the most important thing ever while blocking any Muslim initiative and attending Jewish gatherings for Hanukkah or other Jewish holidays (which is cool, now if only he could treat the other religions the same way). You can imagine how the Muslim crowd in Nice can feel angry at him. Lots of elected officials actually support Muslim initiatives, but Estrosi constantly gets in their way.

Then, the mosque. There is actually no such thing as a mosque in Nice. Truth is, Nice is one of the cities gathering the most votes for the far right in France, so this kind of thing is definitely a hard fight. Nice basically has... prayer rooms. Or as we call them, ""community centers"". I pray Jummu'ah in our local ""mosque"", which is nothing else than a ground floor apartment we rend and treat as prayer area. The Muslim community tried to get a proper worship space for years, and constantly blocked either by Estrosi, either by other far right deputies (oh btw, Estrosi isn't far right, as strange as it sounds). It has been impossible to secure any kind of fund. And when we did, there was always a problem. No permit for building delivered. After signing the papers to buy some land, they got invalidated somehow. Which leads us to the El-Nour mosque. It is a small building in the middle of a work area (most buildings around are just offices and car retailers, no residential area nearby). Thing is, it was funded by a Saudi official. And you know, in France... Saudi giving money immediately has to mean OMG TERRORISM SPREADING. The actual detail is, the Saudi literally bought the land for the Muslim community and said ""do whatever you want with it, now you have a place to worship"". There is no such thing as ""Saudi appointed imam"" or ""Saudi designed education"". But as you know, facts in 2017 are not cool anymore. We just decide to claim that Saudi money = terrorist center. So basically after years of gathering money every possible way (because obviously no public money would be given for this matter) and being rejected every possible way, a Saudi decides to buy land and donate it to the local Muslim association to end this trouble, and well... Nope

The mosque was in standby for a while. In fact, people were praying there, but kinda... ""in secret"". Like, the mosque was not authorized during Ramadan but to show support people would gather there and pray Taraweeh for example. Again, this is an office area, so completely desert by taraweeh time. After a while we won, as the government approved the mosque's opening (note: so much for ""separation of church and state"" and ""secularity"" when the government can decide if you can open a mosque or not). And when this happened, Estrosi went on a press conference to openly say he will ""deploy any mean available to close this mosque down"". Yup. He literally is in a personal war against this. Another example, we opened a private Muslim middle school last year. It is basically a school validated by the government (""Education Nationale""), providing the same teachings as a normal public school, by a diverse group of teachers, with optional religious classes. Nice already has private Catholic and Jewish schools. But guess what happened when we opened ours? Estrosi said he'd do everything he can to close it (if you want to know more about the school [here is the website](http://www.college-avicenne.fr/) )

Now think. How are we supposed to live in Nice, when the very mayor has a personal grudge against us and will never hesitate to publicly declare his opposition to anything we do? How are we supposed to feel like valued French citizens when our mayor supports everything from other religions and just closes down any of our efforts? I don't live in Nice anymore now. I'm in London (and absolutely love the actual freedom of religion here) and go to Nice about once a month to see family etc, and I'm definitely never going back to live there, as much as it pains me to think about living far from my family. But I can see my cousins constantly fighting for the simple right to exist in Nice while being constantly publicly smeared by this idiot. France keeps talking about fighting radicalization, maybe the first step for it would be to respect Muslims as human beings, and this is not likely to ever happen in Nice

"As someone who played countless games vs bots and around 2000 games vs players:
Playing vs bots is fun to learn the rules, but the predictability of bots is really what makes it boring after a while. Bots are always stupid in the same way and after you figured it out you can't lose (except if your other 4 players feed like hell maybe). Split push and the bots don't know how to properly react.
With players it keeps being exciting as they(you) fail in totally different ways and you don't start the game knowing you will win with a 99%+ chance.
About the confidence: The first game I played that had matchmaking was SC2. The stress of clicking the search button got to me. Luckily in Dota2 there are 4 other people on your team who either might carry you... or run you into the ground. 
All in all, if you really like DotA, there's a huge chance you're missing out on a lot more fun than there is vs. bots only. If you need some hints/someone to show you the ropes you can always PM me.",0

"Is there any info on the creation of the Doomhammer? I'm just interested in its history. I know Orgrim passed it onto Thrall but where was it before that? And, since it has grown to be so iconic and will be an artifact weapon in Legion, how is it tied to the elements? Correct me if I'm wrong but as far as we know it's just a nice hammer - it doesn't possess any intrinsic ""magical"" abilities, does it?
**EDIT** More Questions: Putting these here for visibility. 
Why was the hammer okay with being in the hands of the Blackrock clan, a clan of warriors (right?), for so many generations when it is so connected to the elements?
How did it feel about Thrall putting the frostwolf symbol on the side? Why did Thrall do that in the first place? Where precisely was the Doomhammer crafted (which specific pool of magma)? Because hypothetically that same place/material would have the same sentience/character/spirit the Doomhammer has.

"Eh, they're pretty heavily biased in that they don't cover amd products as extensively as they do intel and Nvidia, to the point where they don't even review freesync monitors like they're supposed to (with an amd gpu). The idea that a channel as connected as linustechtips doesn't havr a single amd gpu capable of hitting 60 fps at 1440p is suspect. I know that the common retort is ""hur hur, AMD sucks"", or even ""hur hur, most use Nvidia"", but even when amd does fairly well in a given budget bracket, Linus covers Nvidia and Intel products with surprisingly better depth. 

Not to mention the mindset, ""Nvidia and Intel have the lion's share of their respective market, and thus we'll focus on them"" will only lead them getting even more consumer mindshares, via a sheer greater amount of exposure, which will help lead to an even greater gap. And this is as Linus is constantly harping on Intel and Nvidia for resting on laurels and not innovating like they did a decade ago. Well, why would they when they aren't feeling threatened from either the consumers or the media that covers them?

I know I'm ranting alot, I apologize. I do still think his channel is overall very good, and I generally do enjoy the videos there (and I do want to point out that all three of my pc's run intel, 2/3 run nvidia, but my HTPC has an rx 470), but him and other channels aren't helping with the monster monopolies Intel and Nvidia are amassing. Stating that these companies have the largest market shares, thus covering mostly them, but that you're disappointed about the current state of the PC consumer market, is counter productive towards fixing that.

"nah, I never dismissed anyone for liking it, I called them out on it when they said it was good. You're conflating the two concepts again. They *can* be separated: one is a personal viewpoint, the other is a consensus you can agree to after conversing with a lot of people, and which has elements that others can agree to as well. Will they ever be mutually exclusive? No, but you can weed out a lot of your biases by comparing against other people. Practically speaking, that's *pretty* objective.
I can like things without thinking they're good (Mirai Nikki), and think things are good without liking them (Texhnolyze). 
If someone can actually step me through why they think AgK is good, and I only end up disagreeing in the final evaluation, then I will respect their opinion.

"Glad you agree with the first point, I totally agree with your analysis of it :)
I'll quickly try and rephrase the second in the hope I explain it in a way which makes more sense, maybe it will, maybe it won't. The reason ADAD spamming is a successful technique for dodging hitscan is because when done well it's entirely unpredictable and predictability make you easy to hit. Often if you do a significant amount of damage to someone, use an ultimate or cause them to panic for whatever reason, they will stop focussing on being unpredictable and focus on getting to ""safety"" as quickly as possible (whether that's the nearest cover or a healthpack or whatever). Because they're looking for the nearest path to ""safety"" you often have a small window to get off an easy shot on a predictable target but it generally is a very small window of opportunity you have in order to capitalise on this easy shot. As a result, I've found it incredibly valuable to have a good intuitive understanding of what my enemy is likely to do in order to give myself the best chance at landing this easy shot especially since it's very often the final blow.
I like the Pharah example for this.  If you predict that a Pharah is going to drop to the cover below her after taking a heavy shot from McCree/Widow/Ana then you can simply place your cursor just above the cover that's below her and time an easy shot due to the intuitive understanding you've built up of the speed people fall at. If instead you simply focus on where the Pharah is at that given moment, then reacting to the drop in time is likely to be much harder, especially if she's well positioned fairly close to the cover. The same could be said of placing your crosshair on the path an enemy would need to take to get to a healthpack or the path a flanker would need to take to finish off your incredibly low health support. You're almost ensuring they have nowhere safe to run as their path to safety is blocked by your crosshair so you can more reliably get your shot off whilst they retreat. Essentially, I find it important as it allows you to get a relatively easy finishing shot in a fairly wide range of situations whilst also aiding your game sense at the same time, however, maybe we simply disagree on its importance.
Hopefully I've explained that in a way which makes more sense but cheers for the response either way. Congrats on all the improvement you've made on McCree!",0

That said, you do have carpool lanes for more of the trip down the 405 which isn't the case on the 110.

"That's funny, I was just thinking about this last night when I was watching Bowles on the sidelines during the Miami/Jets game. I remember when I had resigned myself to the fact that Rex was going to be our next coach, because he was the ""big name"" available, and I was convinced that Blank wanted to make a splash. We didn't give him the respect he felt he deserved during the interview, so he quickly signed with the Bills, and the Jets snapped up Bowles, afraid we were going to make an offer to him. Looking back now, I'm convinced that Blank &amp; Dimitroff knew exactly who they wanted all along, this is where Quinn wanted to be, all parties were laying low just waiting on the Seahawk's season to finally end so they could make it official, and that they played Rex, the Bills &amp; the Jets like a Stradivarius violin.  
I have been a Falcons fan for looooooong time, and, even with all the ups, downs, and bumps in the road, this team has been it's most successful since Arthur Blank has owned it. He genuinely seems to have a passion to win in a way that the Smith family never did when they owned the team. I should have had more faith that Blank knew what he was doing, and so far, it's been exactly the right move. Quinn seems to be molding this team into his image, and it's paying dividends already.",0

&gt; Progressive Except Palestine-PEP. A term many of us know and have used to describe someone who has a commitment to progressive causes-civil rights, human rights, movements for justice-except when it comes to Palestine and Israel.

&gt; Being Progressive except Palestine not only means supporting Israeli brutality-it really does mean that-but it also means supporting US imperialism.

&gt; To say Progressive except Palestine makes it seem as if crimes against Palestine and Palestinians are an aside, not central to what makes someone a progressive, ethical person-as if you can say you adhere to principles of justice except for this &amp;quot;One small&amp;quot; thing.

"I don't like using the term 'Indian' because it's so often (at least where I live) used in a derogatory way.  I try to use 'First Nations', because that feels more respectful to me, and less able to be converted into a racial slur.  If someone isn't offended by the term 'Indian', great!  But until I know the person, then I will use a more polite term as I see fit because I don't want to insult them.
I have seen a First Nations guy on a bus wearing a hat or t-shirt that said 'FBI: Flat Broke Indian', so there is probably some type of attempt to reclaim the word from its racist tones, I'd bet like black people calling each other niggers in affection, but I don't feel comfortable participating in either of those.
Not to mention that calling a First Nations person an Indian then leaves me confused as to what I am supposed to call people from India.  Where I grew up, they were called East Indians, and it was rarely in a flattering manner.  I lived for a time in the UK, where people from India were called Indians.  The people who 'discovered' the Americas and called its inhabitants 'Indians' were wrong to do so, so why should we keep up with their mistake?
I'm not avoiding the term Indian, meaning First Nations, because I'm deciding that the person to whom I'm referring will definitely be offended if I say 'Indian', I'm doing it because it's more accurate, and because if they *do* find it offensive, I want to avoid that if I can.  It *has* often been used as a term of insult where I am from, and so I avoid it.",0
"Complaining at that level is just uncalled for, it's likely the most nerve-wracking dungeon in the game to go into because it's your first real party content (Lv10 guildhests don't really count, they're over so fast and you don't get any consequences for doing badly as a result). 
Admittedly I am against marking a kill order, because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they're *not* monkeys with a keyboard, but I can see the need for it if you are nervous or scared as it gives a feeling of security while you get a handle on things and get a fleshed-out toolkit to do your job properly.
The only time I would think ""They have a point, but I wouldn't want to say it myself"" would be after the class has a tank stance - All tanks by then have a full aggro combo, an AoE aggro move and doubled enmity so dealing with random DPS stuff should be easy enough (If it means you can't put out as much DPS, so what? If the DPS are being dorks they're not doing their own max DPS anyway!).
So yeah, the person saying that was needlessly criticising you and any time you may see it in future, ask them whether they would expect a Healer fresh off the boat to be comfortable with pushing DPS or a DPS to go straight into their Lv50 rotation at Lv1. They give you skills as you progress to ease you into play and learning to walk before you run is a perfectly fine tactic.",0
"Well, I literally don't know how to study because I almost always can't form a complex argument. Like, I'm doing relatively fine in calculus 2 now (we are learning ODE's now and it is starting to get harder, at least for me). I did fine on sequences and series, but to be honest I still feel I don't know anything. If I had to prove anything besides than just checking if a series converge (and not any series!) I won't because then I would have to remeber some kind of theorem that I simply don't. I don't know how to explain. Some things I can remember well, but it is just hard to keep track of concepts, definitions and see it all together. Usually you build one concept or definition and then you build another on top of the first one and that's how math works. Then you link it all together and bam, you got something else and that was the whole point of it. Well, that's just hard to keep track, and in the end I end up understanding nothing at all. Or nothing useful. I can remember some details, but it is useless without the big picture.

My point is its harder to put up volume stats than people think. People just think if you're in the game more then you'll have larger stat values. That's not true because people assume linear relationships with stats. The reality is that it's an exponential relationship. Much like a hyperbola. Look at the passer rating stats. QB throws 15 passes a game then he has a higher rating. QB throws 40 in a game then he has a lower rating. You can't linearly extrapolate data. There's no guarantee if you pass 10 times and throw for 2 touchdowns then if you pass 20 times then you should throw for 4. That's not true. Same with interceptions. Volume stats are very important to consider. ,0

"I'm an archaeologist in the Southeastern US. I'll give a brief rundown of my experiences as a grad student, CRM professional, and now college professor.

**Grad student**

Before I had finished my coursework, my day consisted of a fairly early (5 - 6 AM) start to make it to the gym before heading to campus. I can't stress this enough-- get exercise as a student. It will make life better. It's an amazing stress reliever.

I'd get my reading or other work done for class, then settle in to my assistantship, which for a while was as an academic advisor before switching to being a TA. Realistically speaking, the TA position didn't take up much time compared to other things, and I was done with coursework by the time I became an artual ""teaching assistant."" So I also spent a fair amount of my time by that point working on my dissertation or on conference papers. I should have done more publications during this period of time.

I usually went home between 3 and 5 PM, made dinner, etc. Got more work done for the next day.

**CRM archaeologist**

I had done this job before my PhD, so I was mostly ready for what it entailed. Basically, it's a grind. In my opinion, most CRM archaeologists are underpaid for what they do. But this varies significantly between companies. I worked for a less-than-decent company (bad management / CEO, good co-workers in my office).

More or less the same starting schedule as when I was a grad student, but I was usually up about a half hour earlier so that I could get some of my own work / research done before starting in at the office. I usually got to work by about 6:30 or 7 AM if I was in the office (and not in the field). Grabbed coffee, started working on whatever report or GIS project I had going on. A day in the office was pretty much spent cranking on one or more projects of that variety.

When in the field, I had the crew out and ready to go as close to first light as possible (depending on the time of the year). To make sure that I had an idea of where we were going to be and what was going to get done that day, I was usually up by 3 AM sucking down coffee and planning the day, looking at maps and working out acreage that needed to be covered, or units that needed to be dug, etc. You don't ever want to end up in the field with folks standing around wondering what to do. When you're in charge in the field, you should already know what you're going to do when you get to the project area, and you should know what you're going to do in the event that your first plan falls through. Not knowing these things wastes money, time, crew members' patience, and is a good way to get yourself fired if you do it repeatedly.

We did 8-10 hour days in the field (my company didn't do overtime, so I made sure to keep the crew from getting screwed whenever possible-- it's harder than you'd imagine with some companies). Evenings were spent hanging out with the crew and getting artifacts sorted out.

**Professor**

I'm relatively new to this, but I keep largely the same schedule. Up between 4 and 5 AM for coffee and to get my head straight (and maybe post on Reddit). I usually head to the office between 6 and 7 to work on class planning on a research project, or both. On days that I teach, the class planning takes precedence. And because I'm a new professor at a relatively small and teaching-oriented school, it's harder right now to fit in research time. But I manage.

I usually take off from the office between 4 and 5 PM.

---

**What are the upsides?**

For me (especially now) the upside is that I love archaeology and problem solving, and data analysis and writing. I think it's interesting and fun. I'm not (and have never been) a gamer, but GIS or Bayesian radiocarbon modeling in OxCal often substitute. I basically get to be a professional nerd and get paid to do nerd stuff and talk to people about what I'm interested in.

Most of my friends are archaeologists, and although we don't always see each other (most of us are now at different universities or in different cities) we get to catch up at conferences. Hanging out in the bar shooting the shit and trading ideas or making research plans with someone who you met when you were a green grad student, and now you're both professionals (in whatever part of archaeology), is a hell of a lot of fun.

**What are the downsides?**

Work-related stress is a real one. I don't kill myself, but I work a lot. And right now, I'm single and in a new town, and I've been busy over the last semester, so I've not had a chance to meet any new friends. The social isolation is difficult.

In my current job, I am expected to publish research on a regular basis. If you don't like writing or research, that can be a real bummer.

Imposter syndrome can be a big deal sometimes. I have a lot of very smart colleagues (including several that I'm working with right now) and I often feel like the kid in the room with a bunch of adults.

In CRM, archaeology is back- and body-breaking, and for those who intend to go the CRM route, plan to get at least one graduate degree and do your best to move out of being a field crew member before you turn 30. Even after only a few years, I have issues with joints that came from CRM work. I know people who have been doing CRM for 30 years and are in their 50s. They're falling apart, but they still-- because the job sometimes demands it-- end up in the field pushing dirt or a shovel. It's hard on the body, and the benefits aren't there to cover you when you start falling apart from decades of destroying yourself.

CRM can also be soul-killing if you work for a shitty company. The pay isn't usually high enough to make you feel appreciated or valued as an asset, supervisors can often be patronizing (at every level), and it's hard to feel like you're doing what you wanted to do-- archaeology-- when you're pushing through 5 m high brambles or a field of mature corn in August in Mississippi, just to dig another hole a few meters away. A lot of people love it for the good parts, and there are a lot of good parts. But CRM archaeologists don't get nearly the credit (or pay, or treatment) they deserve. They're the folks who do most of the archaeology in this country.",0

"&gt;I think that ultimately anarchists must concede to living in tension with hierarchy and its associated ills. Which is not to say that things can't get better... But 'ending'? Likely not.
I saw this as kindly as I can, but no shit. Of course there's always going to be hierarchy. Anarchism is an endless struggle with an idealistic image of something which will never materialize - like any movement which as 'an ultimate end goal'. Though, even in the absence of utopia, idealism nonetheless propels people to act in their daily lives - pushing toward but never ending up at somewhere better.
 
So yes, anarchism with forever live in tension with hierarchy, utopia will never materialize, power and manipulative shits will never cease, and the world is probably going to go to shit because of ecological catastrophe, resource depletion biogenetic revolutions, societal collapse, or an unexpected cosmic force that destroys all life on the planet. And if not that, matter will rip apart because of phantom dark energy or universe expansion will lead to heat death, or anti-matter and matter will cancel one another out, or something like that.
Nonetheless, we should attempt to bring forth the better and the impossible in futile and mildly-pathetic but desirable and positive efforts.",0

"The way I made it work with the long shell travel time is to find someone, aim in th general area then move to them when fully aimed then fire. This gives them a warning but not until just before you fire I think. Also firing at people already on the move is good, this is where you need skill to make it work though. Since they are already moving they are less likely to start evading, and it is up to you to predict their movements. 
Alternatively try shooting at people that are engaged with your allies, they will be distracted and possibly unable to evade properly without exposing them selves to the people they are fighting.
Also people don't seem to be afraid of arty that much in this game and that is a good thing. If someone is currently engaged with an enemy they may just ignore the arty warning at first since you only do 200 ish damage with a good hit. They can afford to take it if they need to.
So yeah pick the right targets to shoot at the right time and you may have more success. If people really have trouble then arty may see a buff, but I still don't see arty becoming a problem like it is in WoT. Also I would rather have underpowered arty than arty that can 1 shot you.",0

But if they'll pay attention to you and try to help you, you should tell them. And if they don't care about you getting bullied and sexually assaulted, call CPS on them. No one should be treated like this, and the people who let it happen are as bad as the people doing it.
Now, to prevent this to happen again, and since the faculty and students at your school don't care if people harmed, then carry something with you. Like a can of mace, bag of glass shards maybe. But things like that can be unreliable (especially with people whos' eyes are hard to get to) then carry a more physical object. Switchblades are amazing for threatening and easily usable on people, but are much more messy. A blunt object like a thin, short metal bar or, hell, even a sturdy stick would be pretty good.

In terms of MP in NMS. 99% of people here already understood that MP in NMS was going to be very very minimalistic. However based on Sean's numerous interviews, people expected to have the ability to meet other people even if you could not do much together. The reason why this was exciting is because imagine being alone in a universe with 16 quintillion planets and all of a sudden meeting another person. That would be crazy exciting, even if extremely unlikely.

So to sum it up, people that are complaining right now, all they wanted is to have that exciting yet unlikely possibility of meeting another person in a vast but lonely universe. Now it seems that this possibility was taken from them without any explanation or mention. And when asked for some sort of response, Sean dodged like he was running for president or something, instead of giving a ""hey guys we are having issues with MP right now, we will resolve it soon, feature is still there"". 

Now in terms of you shitty attitude. We are consumers. We want to consume good, well designed, finished products. There will ALWAYS be people that wont be satisfied. The question is, can you satisfy as many as humanly possible and attract sales. If the majority likes it, than clearly you are doing something right. We can look at CoD for example. In a critical sort of sense its not a good game because it super stale and just repeats each year which is what people complain about. Yet it still attracts billions in sales, so they are doing something right and hitting their demographic. That however doesnt make criticism of its staleness any less valid. 

I am not a developer but a business analyst. That attitude of yours, is one of the primary reasons why businesses fail. If you make something, and people dont like it, its your fault for making a shitty product not because people have a ""bizarre sense of entitlement"". ",0
Read. [This.](http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf) Book.  ,0
"A little context here(sorry for the wall of words, tl;dr at the bottom) :
Let me start off by saying that I fully agree with the spirit of this bill.  There are a number of distributors here in NC(namely the ones beholden to the macro-beer overlords) that take complete advantage of the system and dick over small breweries, but a good portion of them don't.  Because of these ass hats, along with the fact that the laws are old and need to be updated anyways, the laws definitely need to be balanced more towards the breweries than they are now. 
Unfortunately, this bill goes a bit too far in the other direction and has some stipulations and ramifications that I feel most people are unaware of or glossing over:
1.) Upping the barrel limit from 25,000 to 200,000 opens the doors for a certain kind of brewery to potentially come in and start shitting all over the little guys.  This cap raise is being pushed primarily by 3 of NC's 200+ breweries(Red Oak, Old Mecklenburg, and NoDa) because they have reached or are close to that limit. I've been given the impression that most breweries don't have any interest in self-distributing past their home town market due to the infrastructure demands(though this is speculation based on conversations with brewery reps /owners ; I didn't take a poll or anything). That being said, I think they should be given the option and doubling(not octoupling) the current barrel limit gives a hell of a lot of wiggle room. 
2.) The bill, as originally written, gives breweries the ability to change distribution at the drop of a dime, with no recourse for the distributor.  This has been spurred on by so many people getting burned by shitty distributors, but the good distributors would suffer as well.  In a good partnership, there is a LOT of time and money invested in helping a brewery build their brand and expand to new markets.  This bill would give breweries the opportunity to do this, then cut and run when the legwork is done, leaving the distributor out on that investment. Again, I think this part of the bill is attempting to address a very real problem, but going about it the wrong way. 
3.) It also clears up growler/crowler laws and regulations(as they are currently written, an argument could be made that crowlers are not legal) , as well as setting up a special designation for ""farm"" breweries, both of which I fully support. 
tl;dr : There are implications to this bill that I feel most people don't realize, and it would be bad for most breweries AND distributors that aren't in the pockets of AB or Miller - Coors. I think this bill is being misrepresented on both sides and is frustrating to see an industry that I care so much about get this politicized.    ",0

"It's gratifying to hear you say this; I think you'd be hard pressed to find a lot of argument from the liberal side on that aspect. 
What I think most of us find frustrating within the concept of libertarianism is the lack of enforcement mechanisms related to violations of human rights; what is there to stop companies from poisoning food, for example, in the pursuit of a quick buck? I understand that most libertarians would promote the use of the court system and market economics to redress the crimes, but how does that square with preventing them in the first place? Well funded regulatory bodies are a REQUIREMENT for modern standards of living; if a company could make a quick buck and then dissolve itself (or even if they are punished by the authorities afterwards) there is no preventing the problem before it happens.",0

"Kevin Owens is doing spectacularly on the main roster and his feuds are great. The only thing they dropped the ball on is him seemingly forgetting about John Cena after being beat by him, but that happens to every single heel Cena faces. Just like Bray Wyatt, who forgot about destroying Cena and now has forgotten about anyone but Roman by turning to Brock. The only person Bray succeeded in destroying was Daniel Bryan very briefly and that wasn't really a big feud outside of the iconic Yes on the cage moment. 

Kevin Owens also gets things done when it comes to telling higher ups when they're wrong and things should go a certain way instead of their planned way. He has everything it takes to grab the so called brass ring. He's going to have the WWE WHC sometime between now and the end of 2017.",0

"The helicopter flew on a heading almost directly south. Aboard the craft the crew scanned ahead trying to be the first to see their objective. In the back, the sergeant looked though the photos taken by the flyby a few hours ago. The Nemo appeared to have sustained major damage to her above decks and she was covered with green netting or something, the pictures from above could not determine easily. The superstructure was torn and battered as if an explosion of some sort had occurred but there was no blackened areas signifying fire. Last night at approximately 1900 hours local time a distress signal was sent from this location. Within five minutes it went dead and the ship would not answer any transmissions.
The State Department was interested because a professor from UCLA was aboard with his grad students. Professor Marcus had teamed up with the crew of the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer heading to the south pacific to test his new equipment. The research team was trying to get photographs of the elusive giant squid in the wild but so far only evidence were corpses washed up on beaches. If anyone could locate these creatures and document their existence in their natural environment, they would be the Jane Goodall of the sea world. The difficulty in gathering evidence was it is so hard to see through the water, especially at the depths the specimens lived.
This is where Professor Marcus came into the picture.
Marcus had invented an underwater camera system that not only worked better but also used special algorithms to cancel out the water. The camera emitted a wavelength of energy particles which when returned to the aperture, allowed the computer equipment to analyze the molecular structure and remove it from the video rendering. The result would be fish seemingly flying through air instead of swimming through the water. The camera also allowed vision underwater to a greater distance although at furthest ranges, everything began to dim as if it was being wrapped in shadows.
The State Department was interested in incorporating the device into their submarine fleet if the tests went as expected but wanted to make sure it did not fall into enemy hands. This is why there were vessels positioned a short distance over the horizon from the research area, just in case another nation decided to go after the tech itself.
The distress signal was their signal to jump into action. An initial flyby was sent out immediately but due to the dim light, not much could be seen in the photographs taken by the planes high overhead. A helicopter was dispatched along with a search and rescue team. Of course, it was also a recovery team in case the problems were caused by foreign powers sticking their noses where they don’t belong.
“Sarge, we are coming up on the cords now. There are no running lights on the boat but I think I can make a water landing near the ship.”
“That is all I ask for soldier. Drop us off and park the bird, we may need you in a hurry so keep the engines warm.”
“Yes Sir.”
The helicopter swung over the bobbing derelict and hovered a bit to the port side. Wetsuit clad forces dropped into the water and swam to the side of the ship. The aircraft swung a bit aft and settled onto the surface of the water using its pontoons to support the craft. The pilot cut the engines and kept an eye on the fuel gauge.
In the water, the soldiers swam to the aft of the research vessel to the dive platforms which were already lowered into the water. Easily climbing onto the slightly submerged walkway, they proceeded up the stairs onto the stern of the vessel itself. Overhead, the huge duo lift bars of the stern crane disappeared into the darkness of the night; their only existence was the clanking of the chains as the ship rocked in the waves. One of the side arms lay crumbled across the deck while the other was completely missing, torn from its mounting. The shattered dome of the VSAT lay under the collapsed arm while the rest of the communication system was scattered across the deck. Even the flying bridges were damaged or altogether missing. The ship looked like something took a giant baseball bat and beat everything that stood above the deck until it shattered. A dank smell covered everything, a deep fishy smell from the seaweed draped over nearly all the surfaces.
The team switched to their night vision and moved towards an open deck hatch. Slipping below, the crew found themselves in one of the storage holds where the underwater sleds were maintained and stored. Thick piles of seaweed covered everything and an inch of water sloshed across the floor, the drains plugged by the green growth. Moving toward the bow, the Sarge and his men entered a doorway, unsealing the hatch covering it and stepping though onto the dry floor beyond. Lights on the walls flickered as if they were breathing their last. Working their way through the vessel, they eventually discover the lab set up with several monitors. The power still seems to flicker but the battery backups keep the equipment operational.
“Hendrickson, check out the systems and see if it is operational. Johnson, Michel, and Michaels, continue searching. Try to find the crew.”
“Yes Sir.” The three left the room as the sergeant watched his man type on the computer.
“Sir, it seems all the files are here, the system seems to be operational.”
“Good, play back the footage from before, perhaps we can figure out what happened here.”
“Right away Sir.”

"&gt; It depends on whether laws cause social change or social change causes laws. I personally see it as the latter.
I'm sure there'd have to be some of both.  Society is too complex for it to be only one way.
&gt;I don't think people started liking blacks because some law told them they can't discriminate.
No, but forcible integration will lead *some* people to re-think their prejudices.  I think a good argument can be made that exposure to diversity softens people's resistance.
And then there are children, who can either grow up in a world where their bigoted parents control what kind of people they are surrounded with, setting them on a path to be bigots themselves, or a world where they won't even *remember* a time when they didn't share their community with various minorities.  I think there's more value in gifting *future* generations with diversity, than the current, aging generation.

There are a lot of people who are *begging* for exactly that.  Many of them are legislators.  I don't like the thought of a patchwork nation, where various states across the South and the Midwest can tell gay people to beat it.

"&gt; So I'm surprised there are independent sources backing it up. Those independent could very well be pointing to another kind of split and not the split done with the Prophet (pbuh)
There is no moon-split in any non-Islamic source, from my prior research on the subject. As the moon-split is a rather unique and specific miracle, there should be no case where they point to 'another kind of split'.
So, let's just raise this discussion back from the specific to the generic:
Pretty much every miracle, in every religion, is only recorded in their holy text and no other. While one might argue that this is because rival religions would never record each other's miracles, this argument fails on two grounds: many religions share the same stories, such as the global flood mythology, but with different figures, and it doesn't discount the possibility that the miracle never occurred as described.
Minor miracles, such as the ones on your Facebook link, are particularly useless. Let's look at some of the miracles cited.
&gt;Hazrat Abdul Mutlab(grand father of Rasool Allah(SAW)) was in Qabba that morning and suddenly stone idols fall down and a voice start coming for Qabba.. ""Mohammad(SAW) is born and non believers will fain in front of him""
Did this actually happen, or is it something that they claim happened? How can we verify this story?
&gt;Narrated by Imam Hakim that Hazrat Ayesha(RZ) said ""There was a Jew in Makka, at the night of birth he came out of his house and asked tribe quresh ""is a Kid born among you?"" people said no. He said ""Listen to me carefully! today last prophet of this ummat is born. and oh tribe of Quresh! he is from you""
Did this actually happen, or is it something that they claim happened? How can we verify this story?
&gt;Qureshi people were surprised. all of them went home and very soon they all came to know that Allah has granted Abdul Mutlab a grand son. and on his birth too many un natural things and miracle happen. They very soon came back to him and told him that ""you are right. Abdul Mutlab has a grand son"". He said take me to his home i wanna see with my own eyes. He went there and saw Rasool Allah(SAW). checked his seal of prophetism and said with sadness ""Swear of Allah! Prophetism has went away from bani Israel""
This one gets even lazier, and just says ""miracles occurred"".
&gt;""i was pregnant but i never felt any difficulty from start till end""
Nevermind, I thought we hit the bottom, but an uneventful pregnancy is now miraculous.
None of this is worthy as evidence and serves only as apologetics -- it convinces the convinced.
Generally, it seems the bar for miracles has been set very low, to the point where we are all subject to constant miracles and this makes miracles seem more like misinterpreted coincidence.",0
I guess I'm just more observant.  Don't feel too bad about it though.,0
"&gt;It seems the main point of contention is our belief in how *fast* the world is changing.  You want to maintain a primarily capitalist nation because you think it will help us get to the point where such a thing is already necessary - I say we're already at a point where the groundwork for such a thing is already within our capability.  
In my opinion we're a while off, but we can start to see it on the horizon. There's a difference between something like ""inventing a self driving car"" and ""replacing all current automobiles with self driving vehicles that meet safety standards when deployed in massive numbers"". It's going to be a few decades in my opinion. And even then it will only be a handful of first world nations that will be suited for a UBI. 
&gt;As a software engineer I'm sure you're familiar with concepts like Moore's Law and The Technological Singularity.  We're already over the tipping-point.  It's only a matter of time before someone invents an AI smart enough that it can play the market and put a considerable percentage of the nation's wealth in a single person's hands.  Or some other similar invention flips everything we think we know about the 'numbers game' of big banks and global stock markets completely on its head.  We need to be ready for that.
I agree that when we reach the technological singularity everything will change. My concern is that we'll get ahead of ourselves, switch to economic systems that don't encourage innovation, and DELAY the coming of that singularity. I'd rather see it happen and **then** work on constructing the society once we see what opportunities it brings. 
&gt;I'm glad you're aware that things like price gouging in the pharmaceutical markets are a serious issue - But they're indicitive of the kind of problems you'll get from any industry that's not regulated properly - Which is why I'm so strongly opposed to Trump's constant calls to repeal regulations.
Regulations is a vast term encompassing a huge number of things in a variety of industries. I've not heard of Trump signing anything that is likely to assist pharmaceutical price gouging, but if you know of one I'd be interested. As for the ""2 regs repealed for each one added"" I'm in favor of it. New regulations shouldn't be introduced lightly, if it's important enough to pass then you should be able to find two outdated ones to repeal. Surveys show that over 20% of small business owners identify overregulation as the primary threat to their small business. Canada has introduced a similar ""1 repealed for each one added"" and it's been working out well for them so far. 
&gt;The era of the small business is basically dead.  I don't believe your solutions will do anything to fix that, and I also don't believe there's any solutions available which ever will.  All we're left with now is major corporations, and at-home entrepreneurs who make all their money from a website.
I think PHYSICAL small business is dead because physical retail is currently dying. But would you consider a monetized YouTube account that someone makes a living off of to be a small business? What about a successful Etzy shop? In that vein I'd argue that small business is booming and we should help it along. 
&gt;I'm glad we were able to make this a productive discussion. 
Me too.

"Or the whole world. One of the arguments that the ""free speech"" advocates on the AMA kept using was that you can't just ban people who think and say those things in the real world so people should suck it up and get used to it- as if the amount of hate speech on reddit was at all representative of life outside reddit or off the internet. First off, that type of content makes people who find it distasteful less likely to stick around the website, whereas they don't magically vanish from the world at large. That alone would make that speech seem more common that it is. In addition, there are a lot of people who wills say things like that on reddit but will not say it in their lives off the internet- or at least not indiscriminately so. Someone who uses the n-word on reddit isn't necessarily screaming it every time they go to the grocery store. There are probably a lot of racist people shopping for groceries with you, but far fewer yelling the n-word constantly than you would think if you think reddit is representative of actions everywhere else.

"I'm so sorry you're going through all of this. The loss of the one twin is heartbreaking and I'm sure that doesn't help with the natural worry that occurs during pregnancy, along with anomalous US readings. 

I don't have a similar story, but when I was pregnant, I was put in the ICU for a week or so with sepsis at 26w. I was transferred to another hospital with a higher level NICU since they were fairly convinced I wouldn't be able to carry her to term with how my organs were failing. We thought we were going to lose her.  I spent my conscious time in the ICU looking up survival rates at 25-26 weeks and just crying. I don't understand exactly what you're going though, but I do understand the fear that something is wrong/will go wrong, especially when that fear is founded. I made my husband reiterate the positives the doctors had told us and made a list so when I was feeling hopeless, I could look at it and remember that, while there were chances of something going wrong, there were also chances of things going right. I carried to term and we have a fantastic little girl. 

Hang in there and hold on to hope. If there is something wrong, research and be prepared. Many mild cases of microcephaly are virtually unnoticeable, physically and mentally. It could be just because of positioning restricting growth and things could catch up.

"Groceries and shopping cost more because building parking spaces, especially non-surface parking spaces, costs a lot of money. The number about ten years ago was over $30,000 per space. I bet it's up to $50,000 per space now. The people using those spaces in many/most cases are not paying to use the space, or are paying a subsidized rate. Parking is included in the cost of goods as a loss-leader. However the city mandates the parking spaces. Thus, those who are not using a car to go shopping are paying more for their goods to cover the costs of the subsidized parking lot that the city mandates. 

""With less places to park ...they have less green space on their property.""

I'm not sure where you are getting this from. Comparing downtown Los Angeles, which has mandatory parking minimums, with downtown San Francisco, which has mandatory parking maximums, I much prefer SF and think that downtown SF has much more green space than downtown LA. Also, looking at the battleship condo buildings being built all over Los Angeles which reserve for parking their first level or two, covering all available space on the lot and leaving no space for any green space, gardens or trees, I don't understand how you think mandatory parking minimums preserves green space. 

And I don't think that cars are freeing people in Los Angeles to travel more and experience nature. I've met many (low-income) native residents of Los Angeles who have never been to Palos Verdes, never hiked in the Santa Monica Mountains, never been north of Sun Valley or east of El Monte. For them the car isn't freedom, but an expensive necessity pulling down their standard of living and keeping them poor. ",0

"This is kind of late and maybe you've gotten what you're looking for -

But I did a quick survey in my house and none of us could come up with any reason to put someone on speaker phone when receiving a call, except if the person who is calling wanted to talk to all the people in the area of the speaker phone.

And in that case, we all agree we would at the very least ask or tell the person who is calling that we were putting them on speaker.

You said these people he is around when he puts you on speaker are not your friends, you don't even really know them. So why is he doing this?

There's just no reason for it that we can come up with except maybe to make fun of you. Otherwise he's just being a jerk to all the people around him and very selfish. I mean, why would they all want their conversations interrupted to hear what *you* have to say when they don't even really know you that well? When you didn't call to talk to them? When you don't even *know* you are talking to *all* of them?

Anyway you slice it your BF comes out looking bad. None of us could think of a single reason for him to do this to you that doesn't make him look bad. If we are being kind to him, he just wants to share what's going on in his life with everyone else and somehow thinks it's rude to take a call and not let everyone else hear (maybe they all do this with every call they get - I would ask him if you want to get at the heart of this and not just break up - do all the people in the group do this to people who call, does he do this to everyone who calls when he's with these people? why/why not everyone?) - but pretty much any other version is negative. He's making fun of you with them (and likely has already based on what that guy said about you and your BF just let it go), he's super selfish and thinks what he's talking about *everyone* has to hear about, whether they want to or not, he's trying to avoid having any really serious conversations with you and this makes it possible to do most of the time. I mean, most of this is guessing, only he really knows why he's doing it.

The point is, you are not overreacting. I wouldn't put up with this from an acquaintance, never mind from a lover. My father was a doctor and used to talk to me on speaker sometimes from his office. But it was a land line and it was obvious it was speaker, so I always knew. I can't imagine him doing this when I couldn't tell. I know if he had lived long enough for the tech to catch up and this had been possible, I would have only had to tell him once and he would never had done it again.

I can't imagine why he thinks this is ok. I know you said you talked to him, perhaps you were not forceful enough with your objections? If you think you were, then I would ask yourself why you think it's ok that you told him your boundaries and you were very clear and now you are letting him continue to walk over them even though you said he could not. He needs consequences. Only you can decide what those consequences can be.

Best of luck to you, OP. I hope you get this worked out to your satisfaction, whatever you decide to do.",0

"&gt; What's so special about next year? Is it just a matter of letting coach Mac have ""his guys"" in place for the offense he wants to run?
To me, next year is the measuring stick because there will be no more excuses. Mac will have his hand-picked QBs and supporting cast running the offense. If at this point next year we still look like dog shit on offense, then we have a legitimate problem. 
&gt; I don't agree with the sentiment that it's reasonable to give a guy three years to display basic competence on that side of the ball
It is reasonable in my mind given the current circumstances surrounding our team. When Mac inherited this team, we had 1 capable QB on the team (Grier), and we saw flashes of greatness with him in his limited time here. Then you look at the other 3 QBs we had as options: a glorified WR (Treon), a walk-on backup transfer from Oregon State (Del Rio) and a graduate transfer from Purdue with a career sub-60% completion percentage (Appleby). You could make an argument for throwing the freshmen in there, but at a certain point in the season, I think Mac committed to redshirting them and that is fine. True freshmen QBs are a fickle bunch.",0

"To be fair, it is Piers Morgan. I think that's a write-off. I think many people would take a swing if given the opportunity.

He hit Morgan in the temple with his hook apparently - should have aimed for the chin or the ribs.",0
"I think it's a pretty way to say ""Fin"" as well as being a commentary on history vs. the past. The whole show is narrated like a historical documentary, we get the narrator's moral judgements and analyses throughout the show, which is exactly what history is. We don't get to see everything that a more personal story would show. While facts don't change, history aka people's view of the past definitely does. Now that the war is decidedly over people will be able to view what happened and decide what things mean to them. We can't necessarily understand the true impact of something while it happens, or be unbiased enough to understand why it happened. Like Lebelo didn't really see where the FPA was going and made some bad choices due to that. There is new knowledge out there for people to reflect on now that people can take a step back.  Now that the legend has ended (the war) the story of Reinhardt or Yang is no longer theirs but instead humanity's to make of as it will. 

I think it's very fitting with how the average fan feels after finishing the show. You feel like you  just watched the defining moments of your era and now it's all gone and you are only left to reflect. A big theme of the show is people not understanding history and fucking up because of that, the final words to me are the period at the end of the sentence that is the show and that sentence is, ""Learn from history, because while it doesn't repeat, it certainly rhymes.""

"I had this issue when I first began losing weight. What really worked for me was pre-portioning things. It was extreme in the beginning, but made a big difference until I was able to change my mindset and recognize appropriate portions/quantities on my own. Essentially, after buying groceries, I'd divvy it out into the recommended serving sizes using measuring cups and store it in baggies/tupperware. When I got hungry and instinctively reached for something, I'd just eat what was in the container and when it was gone it was easy to understand ""OK, I've had enough now."" 
Another thing that helps is not having binge-worthy foods in the house. I don't buy ice cream/chocolate/chips because I know I'll destroy them and feel bad about it afterwards. If they're not around, I'm not going after them and can reach for healthy items instead. ",0

The freshwater locked up in the polar ice caps will go into the ocean, making it not fresh water. Regardless, the logistics to get it where it needs to go might be impossible because, as you said, the Earth is large. You can't just transport water from the Great Lakes to, say, Africa.

"35% accuracy and 30% HSR at 45 meters seems slightly high as well. It's within the possible range with quite a bit of skill and a little luck, but not within the ""realistic"" capabilities of most players. An average player would have to be standing still (ideal starting CoF), not under the effects of flinch (i.e., not under fire), and attacking a target who is basically AFK in order to hit that kind of accuracy at that range.
  
For reference, [here's a quick chart showing how large an enemy appears using 74 FoV and a 2x Scope at 10-60 meters, in intervals of 10 meters each](http://ez-link.us/10-to-60-meters-2x-scope-74-fov). At 60 meters, the red dot almost entirely obscures the target's head and torso.  
  
Also, the baseline for Nanoweave bodyshots is 1250 (not 1200).  
  
And... Your headshots are still being applied against a Nanoweave-resisted EHP, even though Nanoweave doesn't apply to them. Your best bet is to simply apply the Nanoweave resistance into the bodyshot damage in your calculations, rather than trying to apply Nanoweave to the EHP of the target.  
  
**So, let's run the simulation using my numbers/model:**  
  
1000 EHP Target.
  
Damage Per Bodyshot: 83 @ 45 meters.  
Damage Per Headshot: 200 @ 45 meters.  
Calculate headshots at the end of each series of bodyshots. We'll assume a skilled player who normally hits around 25% HSR at that range (1 in 4), so after every 3 bodyshots, the next hit will grant a headshot. Also, 33% accuracy will give us a hit every 1 in 3 shots.   
  
You also have to remember that **you can't deal damage with a partial bullet, and you can't do a partial headshot**. The best way to check TTK is to run a simulated loop that checks for a kill, rather than using a formula.
  
Example Sequence with equal spacing:  
  
0ms - bodyshot (total 83dmg).  
66ms - miss.  
132ms  - miss.  
198ms - bodyshot (total 166dmg).  
264ms - miss.  
330ms - miss.  
396ms - bodyshot (total 249dmg).  
462ms - miss.  
528ms - miss.  
594ms - headshot (total 449dmg).  
660ms - miss.  
726ms - miss.  
792ms - bodyshot (total 532dmg).  
858ms - miss.  
924ms - miss.  
990ms - bodyshot (total 615dmg).  
1056ms - miss.  
1122ms - miss.  
1188ms - bodyshot (total 698dmg).  
1254ms - miss.  
1320ms - miss.  
1386ms - headshot (total 898dmg).  
1452ms - miss.  
1518ms - miss.  
1584ms - bodyshot (total 981dmg).  
1650ms - miss.  
1716ms - miss.  
1782ms - bodyshot (total 1064dmg). KILL.  
  
Adjust TTK by [projectile travel time velocity](http://ez-link.us/planetside-projectile-travel-time-sheet) (45 meters at 450m/s = 100ms).  
  
**Full-Auto TTK Projection** w/ Lynx (33% average ACC, 25% average HSR, 45 meters)  = **1882 milliseconds**. *(Actual ACC and HSR in this particular run of the simulation once the last bullet has fired are 35% and 20%, respectively)*.  
  
*PS: When firing in full-auto, equal spacing isn't as common. CoF bloom and recoil make it more likely that you'll hit a large chunk of your hits towards the beginning of the sequence (""frontloaded damage""), and have a larger proportion of misses towards the end. This is slightly simplified for the sake of my sanity -- equal spacing is more common in burst-firing. Speaking of burst firing -- you probably won't be accurate enough at longer ranges without it.*  
  
**One more complication** with comparing ""realistic"" TTK using real-world accuracy stats is **overspray**. The accuracy stats for high-RPM guns are deflated by players continuing to spray bullets after the target has died. Because the [average human reaction time is approx. 266ms](http://ez-link.us/human-reaction-time-statistics), the average player with a 909rpm weapon won't be able to release LMB in reaction to a kill until he has fired at least 5 more bullets than necessary (266/66 = 4.03, decimal is rounded up, because you can't fire a partial bullet). Unless some rounds are hitting a secondary target, all of these rounds will result in additional misses which cannot be attributed to player aim skill.",0

Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.**

"Well stated. Practically speaking, this is an issue that will never have a firm resolution. Its quite obvious, both by looking, and by social customs, that a fertilized cell has little in common with anything we perceive as 'human life'. We celebrate birthdays, not conception days. We give our age as age from birth. We don't name the cell, or count it on the census. People say they have 2 children, and one on the way, rather than 3 children. We don't hold funerals for its passing if the pregnancy fails(generally, anyway, and if so, it won't be public). There are no death certificates issued, no investigations as to the cause of death. Etc, etc, etc. Its rather blatantly obvious we have placed embryos/fetuses in a separate category. 
Its also immediately obvious, to the most basic sense of morality, that killing a newborn infant is reprehensible.
And there is no line between those two points where we can point and say 'Yeah, now its a person'. Just a long, fuzzy continuum.
Its honestly a very fascinating debate, all things considered. The right to life, and the right to control over ones body. Two rights that virtually everyone, everywhere, agree are fundamentally basic rights of all humans, everywhere, intersect at the point of abortion and prove to be wildly incompatible with each other. 
I expect science will make the question moot through some revolutionary contraceptive method for both men and women long before the question is settled.",0
"&gt;Are we even sure that it's a 2-parter?

Not entirely sure, but it generally follows that when a guest writer (well, in this case writers) write 2 consecutive episodes in the same production block with the same director, they are are a two parter.

&gt;Harness was heavily rumoured to be writing Episode 10 

When? It was long established from Doctor Who Magazine that Moffat was doing 10, 11, and 12, but it seems 10 was handed off to Gatiss. Probably because Moffat wanted to help Harness (or Harness wanted Moffat to help him) with such a plot heavy story.

&gt;So I think it's likely that his episode was just moved to be #7 and Moffat is doing a standalone Missy story for #6. 

Not sure if you've fully understood that Harness and Moffat are co-writers for both episodes...  ",0
"As someone who owns VG248QE, i'd say this is totally not accurate, yes it looks a bit washed out especially if you're used to IPS or put it next to an IPS but you can improve it by calibrating it, actually i managed to compare to a friend of mine who owns a highly praised high-end 8-bit TN Panel (PG278Q) and the colors on my VG248QE looked better, more vibrant and less washed out due to the calibration that i've made.
My monitor is calibrated to the following incase you're wondering:
Theater Mode
brightness 66
Contrast 64
Saturation 50
Red 100
Green 100
Blue 100
Overall, it's not perfect and could be better but i think it's practical and you will definitely appreciate it.
Also if you're going to get a new monitor, i would recommend Samsung's new VA monitor (C24FG70), it has the best of both IPS and TN and it's 144hz, it also looks better than IPS:

It does, but it also helps the author to create suspense if you *don't* know exactly what themes your going to be dealing with. Is this a thriller about a paranoid individual or is there actually someone out to do them harm?
If an author desires to put in a warning, I will not criticize them for having done so.

"My extremely close, fun, trusting, platonic friendship with my sister is largely the result of the lust I once felt for her.

I'm a couple of years older than my sister, but we started puberty at about the same time. I had felt sexual attraction to girls since I was a small child, I'm guessing that my natural inhibitions are just lower than the norm. Anyway, when she started developing her body I was attracted to it. Very.

We were comfortable with each other (we soon got along better with each other than any of our other siblings) and she had the innocence of the 10-year-old she was, so I ended up seeing stuff every once in a while. Nip slips, changing with the door open, etc. I was so ashamed and scared, but also desperately pubescently horny. So, I naturally went about things the same way stupid boys do with girls: I treated her like a princess.

Now, she was a bit of a brat growing up, and we treated her like it, so she must have noticed when I started treating her differently. As far as I could (and can) tell, she was appreciative that at least one person in the family enjoyed spending time with her. Wrestling on the couch. Playing video games together. Going to the local pool. I was damn distracted, but still enjoying my time with her. Trying desperately not to be caught in my sneaking glances or be too obvious with my physicality.

It was torturous. The cognitive dissonance between caring about her and what's appropriate in general, and desperately wanting her body, was one of the biggest struggles of my childhood. I remember one night on vacation we slept in the same bed in a hotel room. I stayed up the whole night, all too aware of her beside me. How thin her pajamas were, how easy it would be to stick out my hand and explore, wondering if it would wake her up.

Fortunately, I won this struggle. Nothing happened that night. Shortly afterward, I decided that I needed to get my life back in order (as a thirteen year old, I already felt like my life was a mess) and decided to completely repress any urges or thoughts related to her whatsoever. It took months, and my shame didn't go away for a long time. I honestly have no idea where I got the massive resolve needed.

Now, we're very close, and I never think or feel about her sexually. I suppose on a subconscious level I still know that her body is attractive, but I don't regard it as a prospect any more. We're closer than any of our other family members, to the point that we think almost exactly the same thoughts at the same time (even though our personalities are different in plenty of ways) and have tons of inside jokes. We have so much fun together, and I honestly believe that it was largely caused by my childhood maneuverings.

Nowadays, I'm almost exclusively attracted to women of other ethnicity (my first few girlfriends probably had a lot to do with that), which I'm convinced helps; however, as an adult, I've discovered with a bit of fear and disgust that I also have somewhat of an attraction to girls the age she was when this started (9+, barely starting puberty). It's not as strong as attraction to women my age, however, and I'm not worried at all. I talked to a therapist a bit about that part just to be sure that all is well; despite some weird challenges along the way, all certainly is well. I've honestly never spoken of this as far as I can remember, and I had the urge to get it off my chest just recently, so thank you all for listening.

"I'm a corporate lawyer, so maybe this doesn't apply to me. But I honestly don't have any moral qualms about my job. I answer questions from companies about how to comply with the law, I draw up contracts and other legal documents, and when the company is sued I help present its arguments before the court.

A lot of people think lawyers are immoral when they defend corporations, but I disagree. (1) Regardless of who's right, it's simply not a fair trial if the party being sued for millions of dollars is denied access to legal advice and representation. (2) Companies are in the right more often than you'd think. We get a lot of ridiculous lawsuits from individuals obviously after the company's deep pockets. (3) Many lawsuits boil down to simple misunderstandings between companies about contract terms, and 9x out of 10 we end up settling out of court once the parties come to an agreement.

tl;dr: I sleep well at night.

"FOIA request filed for photographs and/or documents related to a vandalism incident on the CSU Sacramento campus came back with no responsive documents.

This incident is mentioned here. Taken from (https://www.coldcase-earons.com/27.php)

11-7-77: 5:40 p.m.
LE received a call from Sergeant Ortiz of the California State Campus Police regarding a note written on the bathroom wall in a campus restroom. The note, according to Ortiz, concerned information about the East Area Rapist. At 6:10 p.m., LE met with Ortiz in the library at the University. The men's room located on the main floor of the building, in the middle stall on the right hand side, written in pencil, was a message which stated, ""The East Side Rapist was here / Will rape my first black girl tonight / Dumb cops will never find me."" They photographed the message.

I still believe that the release of documents related Tom EARs is possible via FOIA requests. It would be interesting if someone has a list of all EARS related FOIA requests ever filed. I would think something like a request for only specific documents (even if only tangentially related to the case) could succeed in getting additional documents released. ",1

"Spider-Man not only because he's relatable, but because he's full of interesting dichotomies that people often overlook. He's one of the only superheroes with dual classic origins. It was common during the Gold and Silver Ages for characters to be bestowed with powers via some outside accident (Flash/Hulk) or to become exceptional through their own brilliance and ingenuity (Batman/Iron Man). Both of these play an important part in Spider-Man's origin. He gets bitten by the radioactive spider, but without his brilliance in science, he couldn't create the webshooters, an iconic and essential part of his power set. As originally conceived, he's just as responsible for becoming Spider-Man as the accident is. The organic webshooters from the Raimi films completely eliminates this unique aspect of the character and his origins.

He's a nerd and he's not. Most people with only peripheral familiarity with the character think he's always the stereotypical nerd (glasses/always picked on etc) but, although he starts out this way, the character quickly evolves out of this phase (as one realistically would after gaining exceptional powers). The most recognizable version (to comic fans) comes from an era in which the character is social and juggles romantic interests (Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane, Felicia Hardy...) and his failures in these areas stem from his crime-fighting responsibilities getting in the way of his normal life not because he's the perpetual nerd.

The tragedy of his origin also makes for one of the most justifiable reasons to do what he does. Like Batman, Spider-Man puts on the mask because of the murder of a loved one, but unlike Batman, he is partially responsible for the events leading to Ben's death. Bruce Wayne starts on his path after his parents' death, but there was nothing he could do to prevent it. Peter had all the power and opportunity to prevent his Uncle's death but refused to stop a criminal out of selfishness. It's this guilt that drives him not just the tragedy.

Spider-Man is not relatable because he's an everyman. Between his powers and his intellect, he's anything but. What's interesting about the character is that he's so relatable despite not being an everyman.

"Feel alone as I love sci fi. I like fantasy as well. But sci fi has a vague idea of the future, hope. Space means freedom to me (even though with those distances it's almost like a cage). One of my dream is to write some sci fi.

To be fair I'm most of the time disappointed by the lack of quality sci fi (and fantasy to a lesser extent) movies and series.

I recommend stuff like Firefly if you haven't seen. And the Twilight Zone because it's amazing.

I noticed that I love all the ""kids"" universes and themes: science fiction, western, pirates and also fantasy. I'm sad that most of the stuff using these themes are either old, sad as hell, or bad. But we still have some great stuff.

So to answer: Tomorrowland was probably my favorite movie last year.

"Ex-bartender here. Actually the best way to get your drink first is to order something quite simple. For example if people ordered Long Island, some rare whiskey and so on and your order is beer or simple shot of bourbon there is a very high possibility that I'll pour it first 'cause I don't want you to wait 15 minutes for that. 

But that is not a common thing. In some places bartenders prepare drinks strictly in the order that was made by orders. That happens in large bars usually because it's hard to remember everything when you distract yourself. So in this kind of places the best way to get your drink is to wait calmly. If I'm in the middle of something with bazillion of drinks in my mind and you're shouting or trying to tip beforehand - well, it's not about my anger or something like that, I'll make it slower only because you fucked with my memory and I lost the momentum.

"Crazy long story so I'll try to summarize it.

I read a few sections of Craigslist nearly daily and read about a dog that was lost and the owner was pleading with everyone everyday to keep an eye out for her beloved doggy and updating with sightings and the sort. This went on for maybe two weeks. You could tell she loved the dog and was really heartbroken; I felt awful for her.

Then it seems the dog is found / rescued but the ""finders"" refuse to return the dog to the owner. This just kills the owner and she doesn't know where the dog is being kept / where these people live...etc. She continues to post about it on Craigslist begging these people to return her dog.

Well its December 3rd, 2008 and I'm at work. Suddenly someone yells fire and yep, it's my jeep She's on fire. Burns to the ground. Awful, awful day. I have the Mr. pick me up at work and instead of going home we head right to the bar so I can grieve properly. We're drinking in the middle of the workday at this bar and there's hardly anyone else in there and we're making conversation with the bartender. I talked about shopping for a new jeep and Craigslist comes up. From here I mention this stranger's problem with the dog and how sad it is/I'd kill someone if they stole my dog/they must be crushed...etc. Well the bartender chimes in with, ""Is it a white husky? My neighbor at the apartment complex all of a sudden has this white husky that showed up out of thin air and to be honest my neighbors are kinda dicks so that sounds like something they'd do.""

I email the lost dog lady putting her in touch with bartender lady. They involve the police. Turns out it WAS her dog and the police got him back for her and they all lived happily ever after. YAY.

This is changing the subject, though, as the original point wasn't that 'religion is good because it led to the enlightenment and science', but to point out that as a matter of historical fact the rise of science grew out of the soil of the Christian worldview.

"What I suggest is that all of *these* suggestions get the explanations backward. I am not suggesting that human RATIONALBOTS decide to pick and choose their ideology, and Christianity is just one freedom-stifling value system among many. 

What I am suggesting is that individual character, and individual desires and preferences, all stem from the culture that one is raised in and in which one learns to what is right and wrong. So yes, there would be longer and more stable marriages, there would be fewer illegitimate births, and there would be more civic pride and basic decency in a deeply Christian culture. The very idea of ""loveless marriages"" and kids that can't keep it in their pants supposes a culture that values individualism to a radical degree and thus Christian values inevitably conflict with that sort of freedom.

In an actual Christian culture liberal ideals of radically individualist freedom don't enter into the picture. Character, faith, and virtue would all be central to a person's identity, and the very idea of ""freedom"" being stomped upon would not enter into it.",1

"> John Key is a political grandmaster 

Let's be realistic here. Key is, at best, an awkward man who is uncomfortable talking off the cuff and has had fortunate windfalls. 

* He has money, and money can buy gold-class PR advice, which mean you don't have to think hard when the cameras are on. Just stick to the script and all is fine.

* The media here is even more powerless, staffed by spineless yes-men who are more interested in clicks than in reporting, and entirely uninterested in journalism than most other English-speaking nations. This makes it even easier to get away with scripted sound-bites when you know not one mainstream voice will question you, and even if they do, you can easily exploit the fickle ADD of the news cycle to ignore it because there will be no on-going investigations. 

* The population who votes, and who get their political news from this same media, also aren't bothered by how things are. Most of them benefit from it, whether you're an Auckland property investor or a dairy farmer. Everything is fine, or at least looks fine, for them. That rosy outlook means any problems they do encounter aren't due to them and the things they like (which means Key and his National government). No one gives away their golden egg, and there is no incentive to look to the effects of this way of thinking on future generations or the long-term stability of the nation as a whole. 

* The opposition is so embarrassingly weak and ineffectual that the popularity of an awkward banker who has to buy coaching and rely on having lucked into a crippled media and receptive voting demographic in order to have a semblance of popularity (which he still has to pay for), and in other times and places would be highly unpopular, continues to stump them. This is one part due to a constant need to define themselves as *against John Key* rather than pushing a strong positive vision, and one part because they have even less of a grasp of the media and how to generate favorable public sentiment than a stiff banker who had to buy his popularity. This leaves them both unable to generate any positive movement and wide open to Key's counters.

An actual grandmaster would wipe the floor with Key, much the way Trump has cleaned house in the US against people who are cut from the same milquetoast cardboard. Key is a big fish in small backwater, who has paid for big-ticket PR coaching and been fortunate enough to exploit it in a slew of favorable circumstances. If Labour wants to attack Key in a way that sticks, they need to get a better grip on what moves voters and how to leverage the media to make use of that knowledge.",1

>**1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.** The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.


>**3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.** When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V).5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.


>**8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.** Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.",1

For this to be true requires a serious mangling of the left-right spectrum as it is ordinarily defined. In loosest terms the Left is revolutionary and progressive, they want to change and transform existing institutions. The Right wishes to preserve them. 

What passes for the left-right spectrum in recent NZ politics is closer to a doctrinal dispute among revolutionary progressives about what kind of radical change is for the best. The left-wingers you refer to want redistribution of wealth for what they take as the collective social good. 

The pseudo-right of the National Party wants to enact transformation by eroding the existing social and cultural institutions in favor of a politically borderless and economically homogenous global order centered on the interests of elites, mainly in the US and the UK. This is a very recent development, since the 1980s and 90s, and it coincides with the predominance of neoconservative policies in Western nations, which assimilated a revision of classical economic liberalism (""neoliberalism""). This is ""right-wing"" only in name, and it undermines the division into right and left to begin with.

Preaching acceptance becomes conversion when children who may experience normal feelings of curiosity or confusion are told they are transsexuals and placed on chemical therapies.

"I think CCM tacks skates and sticks are very good things. 
Bauer is very popular brand. I'm sure many players prefer bauer because it has huge ad campaign. But in fact CCM and Easton produce   gears that are not worse",1
"Skates are very specific issue. All skates have many different fitting characteristics. Every player should use what is more comfortable for him.
Moreover, skates have other characteristics. For example, hard skates allow player to make sharp maneuvers. However, bauer x100 skates are full composite. But it can be uncomfortable for many players who prefer soft skates like reebok ",1

"Bauer vapor and reebok ribcore have different fit. I advise you to fit all skates in icehockey shop and choose what is more comfortable for you. If you are going to play icehockey often, I suppose you can buy top level skates if you can allow yourself to do it. Top level skates are stronger and they have less weight in the same time. They are more preferable because of full thermoforming and good level of protection",1
"It's good choice for you. V9e and 65S are low-kick sticks. But V9e is top one. Despite of this, V9e is not true OPS. It's fused OPS like your 65S. I think it's not so good because true OPS sticks have better balance as usual. Moreover, V9e is heavy a bit. And I can say it is very soft stick  that creates more force with the same load. 
If you like your 65S, I think v9e is good for you.

"To all appearances Bauer ranks first, Easton ranks second. CCM, Reebok, etc. are outsiders

It doesn't mean that CCM is bad, it is just not so popular",1

it's just a consequence of less weight,1

Gloves of all brands have three lines: anatomical, classic and tapered fit. So, bauer vapor gloves are like ccm cl, bauer supreme is like ccm 30k, bauer nexus is like ccm 4-roll

"It's classic fit gloves. It should be like warriors dynasty.

"hmm.. rbk 20k shoulder pads are more heavy than ccm cl or bauer apx. So, rbk 20k is better for defenders, but ccm cl is better for forwards. It's very important issue in fact. The same is for pants, etc. ",1
"I agree. Every player should buy what is comfortable for him. But it is very important for skates, gloves, pants and so on. Stick is otherwise... bauer apx is like ccm ribkor, warrior dynasty is like bauer nexus. It is matter of preference. Advertising is very important thing in this issue.

Those 'whining companies' could also adopt altcoins.,1
"SegWit is already activated by the miners. For SegWit to have an effect, more addresses need to support it (wallets) as well, since the nodes will only use SegWit if the address sends the transaction using it. Right now only 10% of transactions are SegWit, which is why block size has been creeping above 1MB over the fall. It seems to have gotten stuck, though, because too many addresses still haven’t upgraded.

Lightning will be hugely important. We need it soon, and we need a new generation of walkers that (1) support SegWit and (2) do a better job of selecting the right fee level for the transaction.

For years the network was lightly loaded and many wallets (including the on-line wallet services like Coinbase) used a naive approach to transactions and didn’t optimize the fee offer for the transaction type: some transactions don’t need to be in the next 2 blocks (I can wait a day, if I’m sending money to London, so I don’t need to offer much of a fee), but the wallets I’ve used don’t offer me an interface for fee negotiation/estimation.

https://www.scribd.com/document/264638650/Lyle-Stevik-1

I think that the photos were released (probably by FOIA) to someone working on a book. The book looks like it never materialized, but the photographs ended up on the internet. 

I wonder if the Gray's Harbor Sheriff's Department was happy about that (the sheer number of photographs that ended up online) considering that these photographs have helped fuel years of speculation and undoubtedly countless emails and phone calls to their department. ",1

I would guess that my sharing of a problematic hashtag (which was in a Tweet directed at a Federal agency encouraging them to investigate it) along with my overseas location and a couple of tweets poking fun at Sergei Lavrov in Cyrillic were enough to get me on a computer generated list.

"Here is a weird one that just had an anniversary. A John Doe discovered in Albuquerque in December of 2000. Discovered lying on his side, with some personal effects scattered around him. Curiously enough, his NAMUS profile previously had more information, that was subsequently removed at some point. He had a receipt (or advertisement) from an electronic store in Lübbecke, Germany. He also had “geographical magazines from out of the country” among his possessions. 

Sounds as if someone came across the remains and stole wallet. You would think that a missing German would have been quickly identified - very curious case.

"I agree with you that it has been quiet lately. My two cents about it: I was a long time resident of Seattle, and I find it interesting that there has been virtually zero coverage of the case in the Seattle media.

I find it interesting that the Seattle Times [did such a good thing] (http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/my-god-thats-kimberly-online-sleuth-solves-perplexing-mystery-of-identity-thief-lori-ruff/)with their coverage of the Lori Ruff story. Yet, virtually no media outlets in the Puget Sound have covered the Stevik story.

Considering how much people have obsessed over the case, you'd think that there would be interest in additional coverage in the case from the Seattle media. 

I think that perhaps now would be the appropriate time to consider ways to coordinate attempting to get this case additional coverage. 

I would like to think that Seattle's excellent [KUOW](http://kuow.org/contact-us) or the Seattle Times itself could be options.

If there were a change in the status of the case, perhaps law enforcement in Gray's Harbor would be willing to discuss this update.

Also, on an unrelated topic, someone mentioned that they thought that police reports from the Best Western Ramada in Meridian, Idaho were released. That's the address in Idaho that Stevik used. I've never seen any documents released by authorities in Idaho - has anyone seen these things?",1
"No problem. Maybe we could put our heads together for other FOIA requests to file. Perhaps we could look into all police reports filed at the Best Western in Meridian, Idaho in the years 2000/2001.",1
"Seaside Lyle is only known person with the same name of Lyle Stevik. He is mentioned in the police report. He was questioned back in 2001, and was determined to not be Lyle. He lived (then, at least) in Seaside, Oregon.

There's been some speculation about him (perhaps he crossed paths with the John Doe, or stole his identity) before. 

EDIT: There's another Lyle Stevik on Facebook. This one is Italian. ",1
"Could you PM me also?
",1
The FOIA request wasn't for photographs. It was only for email messages from the public to the email account associated with the investigation. They had already previously released Lyle's photographs (presumably with the full knowledge that they would be posted online). ,1
I was at Bumbershoot in either 2000 or 2001. I actually met David Cross at one of them. The event does draw a lot of people.,1
"Interesting to thinking about. According to Google Translator, there looks to be little difference between ""Stevik"" and ""Stevic"" - meaning that if ""Lyle Stevik"" was his actual name, and if he was an immigrant from Eastern Europe, he could have been using both spellings interchangeably. 

Here's ""Lyle Stevic"" in Macedonian: Лајл Стевиќ

Here's ""Lyle Stevik"" (with the ""k"") in Macedonian: Лајл Стевик

Notice the only difference is the accent character.

I've seen this (people using multiple spellings, especially if they aren't that familiar with Latin characters) happen before with Eastern Europeans - how many times have you been admonished by an airline to make sure that your ticket stub exactly matches what is printed on your passport?

Anyways, I ran some searches for ""Лајл Стевик"" and ""Лајл Стевиќ"" - which is ""Lyle Stevik"" and ""Lyle Stevic"" in the Macedonian language. No Google results were returned - as I don't believe ""Lyle"" in any iteration actually translates into Macedonian. 

I did, however, find a missing person case for one ""Slaviša Stević"" - which would also translate to ""Slavisa Stevick"".

Mentally disabled man who disappeared from Kosovo in 1999 - investigation was initially closed after it was reported he moved to Serbia. Case later reopened at the behest of the father:

http://www.unmikonline.org/hrap/Eng/Cases%20Eng/OP_50-09_ENG.pdf

He (along with 3 other ""Stevics/Steviks"") appeared in a news release from 2001 - all reported as being kidnapped. 

https://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg62170.html

Kind of interesting, but I doubt it is related to old Lyle. 

Begs the question, however. What harm would there be in having the Macedonian press writing up an article about this? All the info in the case is easy to find. If Macedonian press picks it up, perhaps in the off chance he's from that part of the world, maybe a family member will recognize...",1
"I've heard about the Stevik case for some time now. I had thought I read it mentioned that in the immediate aftermath of the discovery of his body, someone suggested contacting the FBI. I filed a FOIA request for any files that the FBI might have on Stevik. A response was returned that there are no files. 

Perhaps we could put our heads together about any other FOIA requests that might be applicable to this case. ",1
"Well, if you're interested. Here's an awfully strange one: https://www.identifyus.org/en/cases/15524

Found in Vacaville, California in April of 1979. Described as ""muscular"". The third, fourth and fifth fingers of the right hand had been amputated and repaired (reportedly in a crude, unprofessional manner) years before. 

John Doe was murdered, and found on the side of the road.

Here's another weird aspect. The belt he was wearing was for ""J.Press"" which I believe at the time was a very upscale clothing maker on the East Coast. He was also wearing underwear from K-Mart! Made me think of Rain Man. ",1
"Article above states that they were that Mervyn's was primarily a California company. I used to frequent Mervyn's as a kid. It was a low end department store. Although it was primarily a California company, in 1998 they had also stores in Georgia, Florida, Arizona, Texas, Michigan and Minnesota. From the article linked to above, it seems as if they are manually comparing the fingerprint to people fingerprinted in California.

Seems as if they should add other states (including Minnesota, which is closest) to those cross checked for matches. ",1

2. YOU, Dysphoria, don't make sense. Maybe my 'self' is a guy, and there are no rules against being a feminine/flamboyant guy. And if someone thinks there are, they're simply projecting sexist bullshit onto others.

3. Disorder breeds disorder. I am a broken wooden post that can't hold the roof anymore. I need fixing. If I break, the roof will fall and I won't be supporting it. If I'm repaired, things will stay in place and the order is preserved. The only selfish thing here would be to push others away, give in to dysphoric thoughts, decide that everyone's against me while most likely they just don't understand why I'm breaking.

The B-52 and B-2 bomber still retain the capability to conduct nuclear strikes, making the US one of only a handful of countries which has a 'nuclear triad' made up of nuclear-capable bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and sea-based ballistic missiles.B-52 bombers are capable of launching nuclear-armed cruise missiles. And they even play as part of an American nuclear ""umbrella"" over South Korea and Japan.",1
"The problem is that America aspiring being the hegemon in all spheres. And its desire prevents the government from paying attention to social sphere. Yeah, we have good military and political development, but what about our social needs? What about healthcare system, education and so on? I doubt we can name the USA the most powerful nation in social issues. ",1
"Yeah, that is..",1
"I don't know why, but the portrait reminds me Tom Hanks",1
I don't think it's a good idea to get on Russia's nerves. As well as if the USA supports the idea of nuclear non-proliferation when for what it uses nuclear-capable bombers in military exercises in Europe? Does it want to repeat Cuban missile crisis?,1
"Of course, he can. But we shouldn't forget about his brother, who got us into two wars that were completely uncalled for and caused thousands of our troops death and horrid injuries not to mention all of the innocents that died in those countries.

"Good guide, recommendation to scan the entire market is definitely very useful, especially considering the number of altcoins on the market. If you decided to invest in altcoins, do a thorough research and choose wisely. As for me, I invested in TIE and SPHR. It doesn't mean that you also have to. You have to buy tokens on the basis of your own analysis, not on the basis of shillers on reddit.  ",1

TIE and SPHR ,1
Germany seems to be a technological laggard. It looks like nobody who works in German government is interested in crypto. ,1

They have to pay tax on the medal. Would they have to pay tax on the bitcoin?,1
"I recommend you forget trading and:

(1) Do analysis of good coins/tokens, paying more attention to coins/tokens that are not very popular (I chose Ties and Sphere, not shilling, just sharing my experience). (2) Buy those that look legitimate and have good prospects. (3) HODL, live your life and don't worry ",1

"These crooks are trying to manipulate so ""wisely""... Crypto community is under attack by Wall Street swindlers owning mass media",1
"There are several tendencies that can explain why lots of people are sure that Ethereum is going to significantly increase this year. 

First of all, Bitcoin, many people think, has already started to decay. The price of Bitcoin felt, and it's impossible to predict whether it will recover or not. 

Secondly, in contrast to Bitcoin that is considered as a mostly speculative instrument, Ethereum is a powerful platform giving a lot of opportunities to create new projects.

Thirdly, it is important to note that 80% of the daily transactions across a lot of coins run on Ethereum which means that it has a strong position.

I am not saying that the price of Ethereum will definitely increase. It is impossible to predict. But there are several chances that it can increase.

"But Litecoin was created exactly for this purpose, wasn't it? ",1
"Advertisement fucked up. 

Moreover, the article is filled with misinformation. Bitstamp has already got a license to work in EU. ",1

A man was raised as a Samurai, but when he was finally of age to serve, his master died, and he was not allowed to commit seppuku. It was the beginning of a hundred years of peace, and thus this Samurai of a proud clan had to sit by and watch society fall apart, as the martial path fell to the wayside.

As an old man, a young scribe would sit and chat with him, and write down all his nuggets of wisdom.

It's written very much like the ramblings of an old man, and sometimes contradicts itself, but it is a guide to living by action, honour, and accountability.

Though it is a few hundred years old, it is shocking how many parallels there are between his society and ours today.

REQ is building a platform, I interpreted the post as a way they are trying to incentivize the community to build various use cases for the protocol.

ETH started a fund a couple weeks ago to support teams that wanted to help with scaling, why was this not looked on negatively?

Thinking that REQ is gonna build all these use cases for their platform is insane, it's like expecting ETH to build all the Dapps or Apple to build all the apps for the iPhone. calm down guys.",1

"So Req decides to actually “decentralize” the development of the project and people are giving them shit for it? Saying “oh they couldn’t meet their goals, they couldn’t get things done” Decentralization is the core of blockchain and when a project actually makes and effort to decentralize their development they are hung for it. It’s pathetic seeing how some people are viewing this announcement. It anything it brings more confidence to the Req project. You think if the team was so far behind meeting timelines they’d want to bring it outside devs who could easily leak detrimental news about being behind on milestones with absolutely no repercussions to them? If the community views an announcement like this negatively you really need to re-evaluate your alleged support for “decentralization”.",1

"Philosophy.

Seriously I only discovered what philosophy actually is until after I left school. Not only is it really interesting but it's really helpful. Philosophy teaches you to question what you're faced with, and approach problems with logic not belief. It's the cure for gullibility and ignorance. It helps you take control of your base emotions and think clearly. This is coming from someone who used to be seriously irrationally angry over very tiny things in his life. That fucking sucked. But now for the life of me, I just can't see the point in putting myself through pain like that.

Sell BTC holding for VEN and ICX this year?,1
We've seen many projects and icos that got rekt by security or wallet issues. I'm glad Vechain step up their game and prepare for the worst.,1
At first glance Vechain seems promising and I've decided to invest a little bit into it. But I don't understand why all the comments are 100% either in support of Vechain or against Vechain. I agree this accomplishment does seem news-worthy. But I do also see Vechain posts a lot on here. I understand people being excited about their coins but is that what is actually causing people to dismiss recent news from Vechain? Are there other factors causing people to dismiss Vechain other than being bombarded with news about it?,1
"Just read the article after seeing the tweet pop up. Very exciting, it's a step in the right direction and this will help people take VeChain more seriously when looking to transition. VeChain seems to be doing everything right at the moment :) it's nice to see companies starting to come up with solutions for mass adoption and gaining trust. ",1

"I don't think they are as much, its just easier for the vocal minority to get attention in the internet age. Most people I've met in real life couldn't give to shits about a lot of 'Offensive' stuff. ",1
Because society has taught them that Victim-hood is empowerment. ,1
"I think it's a process. 24 hour news cycle creates a demand for more newsworthy content. They inflate minor controversies to what they consider newsworthy levels. They also give voice to very small minorities who do actually feel offended, but historically would have been dismissed, rightly so, as not newsworthy. So we are much more exposed to people being offended by things, and we start to see the world in those terms. We have been trained to look for things that are ""offensive"" even if they don't actually offend us personally. We get offended on other people's behalf, which isn't always a bad thing, but it can lead to a situation where no one is genuinely offended by something but we're all acting offended so as not to seem offensive. Eventually people become hypersensitive to potentially offense causing behavior and are empowered to vocalize it.

That's not to say that there aren't offensive things out there worth speaking up about. I think our society is better when it allows people to have an open discussion about those things. There is a danger though, of raising every seeming offense to an equal level.

",1
"Well on the other hand Turks themselves have bombed mostly Kurds in Syria while this conflict but not ISIS targets, haven't they? So we can expect Russians in the guise of Syrians of course will shoot down a couple of their jets on a mission too.  ",1
I think you are right except civilians with arms cannot already be called pure civilians so I guess militants kill militants and the problem of this incident is that Russian jet was shot by Turkey which would-be    a so-called anti-ISIS coalition member too and now it's unclear who is fighting whom over there at the moment. ,1
"That's the point - ""reportedly"". ",1
In this case we are all quite lucky it was a Russian jet shot down by Turks because today any local nuclear conflicts are just impossible without spreading worldwide sooner or later. ,1
I think in the case of another war on the Soviet Union in 1945 Poland could have become extinct altogether so they were quite lucky then neither Roosevelt nor Churchill started it. ,1
Very sarcastic but exactly correct and it's seems normal concerning Turkish-Russian relationship - first Russia accuses Turkey in that infamous Armenian genocide making them quite unfriendly but then Putin offers Erdogan that gas project just like they are close friends really. ,1
Partly right and surely NATO will buck up its ally Turkey but sooner or later either anti-ISIS alliance or Russia or they together will destroy oil facilities of ISIS in Syria on the other hand Putin will suspend that gas project with Turks so it'll be the double loss for them and Erdogan will have to deal with it this way or another.  ,1
But now it has happened and Erdogan seems to keep silence concerning the accident and I think so makes the relationship with Russia worse although first of all it's his task to clarify the issue and make friends with Putin again.  ,1
Well I think at the moment no military official can independently order to shoot down a Russian aircraft without the president confirmation because in the worst case it can mean a war and now I guess nobody wants a military conflict with Russia or China. ,1
Really I cannot understand how altogether Erdogan could bring himself to shoot down that Russian jet just after so many peaceful and economic talks with Putin recently about all those great gas-oil projects potentially coming soon. I think Russia will answer to it correspondingly. ,1

Really you are right but the above version is OK too.,1
But really why did they trow her away - they could use her in a multiple other ways indeed.  ,1

Agree completely and support your opinion absolutely besides I don't think it's bad if Muslim children can just listen to our carols sitting in the hall and vise versa Christian children can visit some Muslim festivals in the same school concert hall. And only like this we can create true religiously tolerant society but not banning these or those holidays.   ,1
"No, I don't think so especially when a religious practice has gone into a certain cultural traditions long ago. Well it's OK for me to go into a church of any confession to pray and to burn a candle and I don't think I betray my original faith.   ",1
Exactly! ,1
I think that's too far. ,1
Christmas is a great cultural tradition worthy to stay untouched forever in any Christian country like Italy or France because I think strange people should adjust to the local culture but not vice versa. ,1

That always happens if a person feels too much power. Especially if he is not the brightest bulb in the bunch. We need to do something about our police but I have idea what we have to do.,1
"I don't believe in God but I can't understand those militant atheists. Christianity is not a religion any more, it's just a way of life and a sort of a culture within culture. People just love those symbols as they feel belonging to the group of people who share their Christian views.",1

Our healthcare system is just broken. If only we could destroy all those churches we have everywhere and build hospitals instead... We really need to change something in our healthcare.,1

"Trump is just a master troll. His supporters don't care about the things he says anymore, he is like the messiah for them. They just agree with Trump no matter what he says.",1
Why does he even run for the president? He has no change to win anyway. I can't understand all those GOP candidates who still keep trying.,1
Trump just went way too far. He needs to care more about the things he says because he sounds like a racist and bigot. Though it looks like people don't care about it and he will be the next president.,1
"It won't help him to win anyway. Not too many people are going to vote for Sanders, he is way too liberal and way too progressive. ",1
I believe that feminism is the cause. They want to find a strong man to depend on but can't find one in the West so they flee to the Middle East in order to find happiness.,1
She has always been a hawk there is nothing new here. She just appeals to Trump's audience cause it seems like there are more Americans leaning towards conservatives. So she decided to abandon her liberal agenda.,1
Trump and Sanders are completely different candidates. It would be more appropriate to compare Trump and Biden though his hasn't announced his campaign yet.,1
"Ted Cruz is a horrible politician. His just follows Trump everywhere, he doesn't have his own agenda. I can't see any good GOP candidate this time though Democrats are not any better.",1
"And that's the country we are going to make our ally. Better to stick with Israel, it's the only democratic country in the middle east.",1
"Why are they even do that? I mean accepting so many refugees... At least they have to check their background to make sure there are no ISIS supporters among them. Well, we definitely need to help those who are in need but we don't need to put our own house in danger.",1
That's such an old song. We need to change something about our copyright laws. I think every song/movie/videogame has to be allowed for downloading for free in 20 years after its release.,1
"It's really hard to meet a real Christian nowadays. Young people might call themselves Protestants or Catholics but they are not true believers. It's more about their self-identity. So there is no difference between catholics, agnostics or atheists these days.",1
"Well, they are kinda right. Racism still exists in America and it's not like we can change anything about that. It would be better to learn how to live with it because we can't change the human nature. Cops are usually not the brightest people so they use to treat people according to their looks.",1
What was the point of banning them in the first place? All those drugs were used for medical purposes when they were created. 50 years have passed and only now people are slowly starting to open their mind just like they did it in the late 60s.,1
"If the attackers are Muslims it's a very bad sign for Europe.
Yeah, that's clearly understandable that Europeans just want to help those who are in need. But they really undermine the very foundation of their society based on old Christian values. I'm not a religious person but we should respect and protect all cultures, including European ones.",1

I think she had sexual contact with her student during off-duty hours,1
"I say about mutual agreement where there is no violence. Moreover, we should listen what a victim says. Maybe husband and wife are both into BDSM, but the judge can be sure that it is domestic violence. Should be couple jailed if the law says that acts affecting body is a crime? Mutual agreement is very important point!

P.S.  According to a 1998 study of college students who experienced sexual relationships with an adult while still a minor found that the adolescent was not harmed by mutually consensual sexual experiences. When harm was discovered the harm came from the adolescent's dysfunctional family of origin not from the sexual relationship with the adult. The study also included a statistical study of thousand of older record of alleged adolescent sexual abuse by an adult and found the same relation between mutually agreed upon sex between the adolescent and an adult did not cause any emotional harm. Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

2) Partnerships - BOSCH bought a lot of IOTA. Volkswagen has a person in IOTA foundation. A huge amount of participants in DATA marketplace. TOKYO partnership, now Taipei partnership and a LOT of smaller projects. Even Oyster pearl - a favourite here- is made on IOTA tangle.

I know I typically wouldn't.

PayPal sucks for merchants, yet it's still widely accepted because consumers love the protection it gives them. Consumers drive adoption of these payment systems. Consumers are not going to use a payment system that's irreversible.

Maybe husband and wife are both into BDSM, but the judge can be sure that it is domestic violence. Should be couple jailed if the law says that acts affecting body is a crime? Mutual agreement is very important point!

P.S.  According to a 1998 study of college students who experienced sexual relationships with an adult while still a minor found that the adolescent was not harmed by mutually consensual sexual experiences. When harm was discovered the harm came from the adolescent's dysfunctional family of origin not from the sexual relationship with the adult. The study also included a statistical study of thousand of older record of alleged adolescent sexual abuse by an adult and found the same relation between mutually agreed upon sex between the adolescent and an adult did not cause any emotional harm. Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

"no man no.. i just cant and probably wont understand... u running mad man towards a couple of cops?? u know every job gots it risks. not taking risks doesnt mean doing your work badly/poorly. at least make a shot just to stop him in the leg. aren't there shooting training/programs for cop? you asking what type of training im talking about? and this video u showed of a huge man is far different from this lame madman. Be real. This is not a one on one affair. there were cops. not a cop. warnings made to a madman to stop running? that man could have been kicked once in the face and that was all. Did the mad man run towards people on the streets to kill them? Ha its funny when you talk like that rewatch the video again man. Atleaaaast a shot in the leg!!!!! common u want me to believe that running guy was in a kill chase? sometimes you know we gotta be real. For me that killing was so uncalled for. And its wrong to defend them thinking about them risking their lives. And u never know what choices iv got to make so dont even mention yh :) And you even have no idea who i am so dont take this personal. I dont need to apply for a job as a cop to voice my views tho.

u trying to say cops arent trained enough for that. Than man had no weapon for christ sake and there were more than one cop. i saw so many videos of how cops in other states deal with mad people. Taking someone's life really isn't and shouldn't be an option for cops unless there is really the need to. Its just like an ordinary man putting on the uniform, grabs 1 or 2 weapons/tools and goes out there to protect citizens. Cops are and should be trained get that point please. they could have done pretty much better trust me. Its so sad we dont understand such cases because these victims are no relatives to us.

The cops could have gotten the earrings off without necessarily tasering her. shes goddamn old for Christ sake. there were other officers around. couldn't they just handcuff her and get the earrings off? i think tasering her to fall (break arm) was just too lame. arent cops trained to act better in such situations (with old women) than to just tase after after a little resistance. she obeyed all instructions till the point of taking off her jewels. i just dont get this as a being a procedure man. Its seriously lame. Like cops are trained to shoot and tase and thats all... common guys!! ,1

" 1. Start Small - Start with something you can do immediately and easily. When we start with small successes, we build momentum to gain more confidence in our abilities.
2. Create a Compelling Vision - Use the power of your imagination. Create an image of yourself as the confident and self-assured person you aspire to become. 
3. Socialize - Get out of the house or setup a lunch date with a friend. Socializing with others will give us opportunities to connect with other people, and practice our communication and interpersonal skills. 
4. Do Something that Scares You - As with all skills, we get better with practice and repetition. The more often we proactively do things that scare us, the less scary these situations will seem, and eventually will be rid of that fear.
5. Do Something You Are Good At - What are you especially good at or enjoy doing? Regularly doing things that you are good at reinforces your belief in your abilities and strengths. I (Tina) can be very efficient with completing errands or administrative work.
6. Set Goals - According to a study done at Virginia Tech, 80% of Americans say they don’t have goals. And the people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetime as people who don’t.
7. Help Others Feel Good About Themselves - Help somebody or teach them something. When you help other people feel better about themselves and like themselves more, it will make you feel good about yourself. 
8. Get Clarity on Life Areas - Get clarity on the life area that needs the most attention. Your self-esteem is the average of your self-concept in all the major areas of your life. Write down all the major categories of your life, e.g., health, relationships, finance, etc. 
9. Create a Plan - Having a goal alone won’t do much. Get clarity on your action items. One of the biggest reasons people get lazy is because they don’t have a plan to achieve their goals. 
10. Get Motivated - Read something inspirational, listen to something empowering, talk to someone who can uplift our spirits, who can motivate us to become a better person, to live more consciously, and to take proactive steps towards creating a better life for ourselves and our families.
11. Get External Compliments - As funny as this point suggests, go find a friend or family member and ask them “What do you like about me?” “What are my strengths?” or “What do you love about me?” We will often value other people’s opinions more than our own.
12. Affirmations & Introspection - Use affirmations, but in the right way. Some people think that when they’re in a slump, using positive affirmations will help them get out of it. I love affirmations, but I’ve realized you have to use them in the right way. 
13. No More Comparisons - Stop comparing yourself to other people. Low-self esteem stems from the feeling of being inferior. For example, if you were the only person in the world, do you think you could have low-self esteem? Self-esteem only comes into the picture when there are other people around us and we perceive that we are inferior.  ",1

Yeah, i care. I did not violate rules of subreddit. I do not think that donotshoot site deprives the original owner of potential ad revenue.
If a couple of guys do not like these submissions(because they are subscribers for years and have already seen everything) , that does not mean that others don't like them too. Look at the likes and usual number of comments. People like it. It is good for your subreddit. /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut is dedicated to activism and investigation of police misconduct. People like it. There are no violations. You do not deprive somebody's revenues or involved towards this. If you give ban that gonna be not fair and illogical. 

",1
"1) Activism against police tyranny does not necessarily have financial motives.
 
2) I am NOT paid by donotshoot site or have relationship with their staff.

3) If you know any other site with regular updates of hot videos of police misconduct evidence (simple articles or searching youtube is boring), I will be very grateful to you.  

I hope that these arguments are pretty enough to show i am not a bot. Never judge people and their beliefs without having understood. Commenting, criticism and labeling people is simple. You can't tell a book by its cover. 
Thanks for understanding. Have a nice day.
